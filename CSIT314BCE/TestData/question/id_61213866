<p>Trying to understand the Python for-loop, I thought this would give the result <code>{1}</code> for one iteration, or just get stuck in an infinite loop, depending on if it does the iteration like in C or other languages. But actually it did neither.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = {0}
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in s:
...     s.add(i + 1)
...     s.remove(i)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(s)
{16}
</code></pre>

<p>Why does it do 16 iterations? Where does the result <code>{16}</code> come from?</p>

<p>This was using Python 3.8.2. On pypy it makes the expected result <code>{1}</code>.</p>

<p>I want to delete a branch both locally and remotely.</p>

<h2>Failed Attempts to Delete a Remote Branch</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>$ git branch -d remotes/origin/bugfix
error: branch 'remotes/origin/bugfix' not found.

$ git branch -d origin/bugfix
error: branch 'origin/bugfix' not found.

$ git branch -rd origin/bugfix
Deleted remote branch origin/bugfix (was 2a14ef7).

$ git push
Everything up-to-date

$ git pull
From github.com:gituser/gitproject

* [new branch] bugfix -&gt; origin/bugfix
Already up-to-date.
</code></pre>

<p>What should I do differently to successfully delete the <code>remotes/origin/bugfix</code> branch both locally and remotely?</p>

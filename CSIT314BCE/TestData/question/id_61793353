<p>function must take two string arguments: one, a string which is to be rotated and the second string denoting any number of rotations in a particular direction with specific magnitudes. The second string is in the form of : X a X b X c ....... Where X denotes the direction of rotataion which is either L or R. a,b,c... are integers which denotes the magnitude (not more than 9) of the direction which is in their left side.</p>

<p>For example, if these are the arguments : ("abcde","L 3 R 2 R 4")
The ouput would be YES</p>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Here, number of rotations are 3.</li>
<li>After applying first rotation L 3, the string is:
  'deabc'. Here, the first character is 'd'</li>
<li>After applying second rotation R 2, the string is:
  'bcdea'. Here, the first character is 'b'</li>
<li>After applying third rotation R 4, the string is:
  'cdeab'. Here, the first character is 'c'</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, after all the rotations the FIRSTCHARSTRING string will be "dbc" which is an anagram of a sub string of original string "abcde".</p>

<p>here is what i tried but not getting anywhere</p>

<pre><code>
const task18 = (str1, str2) =&gt; {
  let count;
  for (let i in str2) {
    if (str2[i] === "L") {
      let ans = str1.substring(str2[i + 1]) + str1.substring(0, str2[i + 1]);
      count = ans[0];
      return ans;
    } else {
      return str1.substring(str1, str1.length - str2[i + 1]);
    }
  }
};
</code></pre>

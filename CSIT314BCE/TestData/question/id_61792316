<p>When running following code, I get an error in XCode output saying</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>nw_path_close_fd Failed to close guarded necp fd 47 [9: Bad file
  descriptor]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;boost/process.hpp&gt;
int main()
{       
   boost::process::ipstream outStream;
   boost::process::system( "df", boost::process::std_out &gt; outStream );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Boost version 1.70</p>

<p>XCode version 11.3.1</p>

<p>Error is also present even if I just run <code>boost::process::system( "df" )</code></p>

<p>Saw this post: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57752670/boostprocess-system-leaking-file-descriptors">boost::process system leaking file descriptors</a> , I tried making the change suggested in posix/executor.hpp. But I still get the error. (After making the change I did not do any boost library build. I thought, it might not be required as it is just an hpp file change) </p>

<p>How would you explain JavaScript closures to someone with a knowledge of the concepts they consist of (for example functions, variables and the like), but does not understand closures themselves?</p>

<p>I have seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">the Scheme example</a> given on Wikipedia, but unfortunately it did not help.</p>

<p>I always thought Java was <strong>pass-by-reference</strong>.</p>

<p>However, I've seen a couple of blog posts (for example, <a href="http://javadude.com/articles/passbyvalue.htm" rel="noreferrer">this blog</a>) that claim that it isn't.</p>

<p>I don't think I understand the distinction they're making. </p>

<p>What is the explanation?</p>

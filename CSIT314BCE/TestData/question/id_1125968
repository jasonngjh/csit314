<p>How do I force an overwrite of local files on a <code>git pull</code>?</p>

<p><strong>The scenario is the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A team member is modifying the templates for a website we are working on</li>
<li>They are adding some images to the images directory (but forgets to add them under source control)</li>
<li>They are sending the images by mail, later, to me</li>
<li>I'm adding the images under the source control and pushing them to GitHub together with other changes</li>
<li>They cannot pull updates from GitHub because Git doesn't want to overwrite their files.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This is the error I'm getting:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>error: Untracked working tree file 'public/images/icon.gif' would be overwritten by merge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do I force Git to overwrite them? The person is a designer - usually, I resolve all the conflicts by hand, so the server has the most recent version that they just need to update on their computer.</p>

<p>I was adding modules and I decided that I don't need them so I deleted them and got this message </p>

<p>Here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>import random


class tic_tac_toe:

    a = [["-", "-", "-"], ["-", "-", "-"], ["-", "-", "-"]]

    _player = None

    row = None

    column = None

    _win = False

    _draw = False

    _moves_iterentor = 0

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwags):
        self.x = input("Choose your symbol: ")
        self.o = input("Choose your symbol: ")
        self._player = random.choice((self.x, self.o))
        self.game()

</code></pre>

<p>Why doesn't this code print same number? : </p>

<pre><code>long long a, b;
a = 2147483647 + 1;
b = 2147483648;
printf("%lld\n", a);
printf("%lld\n", b);
</code></pre>

<p>I know that int variable's maximum number is 2147483647 because int variable is 4 byte.
But as I know, long long variable is 8 byte, but why does that code act like that?</p>

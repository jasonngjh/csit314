<p>I was working on a publishing platform of sorts where users can sign up and create a blog for themselves. Currently I was planning to host it on <a href="https://vercel.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://vercel.com</a>. How would I set up something so that users can use their own domain and get only their blog on that domain. I'm sorry if the question is a bit too broad but if someone could point me in a general direction I would be very grateful. The only thing that comes to mind would be setting up a DNS server and then using that to route the users domain but I don't know if that's the right way to go about it. Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

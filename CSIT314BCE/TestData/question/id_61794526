<pre><code>def move(s: String){

if(s.equals("l")){
  al()
}else if(s.equals("r")){
  ar()
}else if(s.equals("u")){
  au()
}else if(s.equals("d")){
  ad()
} }
</code></pre>

<p>the code above is something I have tried but doesn't work. It should be able to get multiple strings like (lrudd) in one line and each letter equals to a function. 
so if lrudd is entered the al(), ar(), au(), ad(), ad() function should be done, its a 2d game so the player should move al()- which is left, ar()- which is right, ar()- which up and ad(),twice as down is entered twice (dd) </p>

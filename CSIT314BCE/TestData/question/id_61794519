<p>My team look after a pair of servers in a Windows 2008 SQL cluster, and the app guys have decided that they want a reboot of both nodes adding to regular maintenance cycles. Since we'd have to dial in in the middle of the night to do this, I've decided to try and automate it instead - I know I can bang my head against powershell long enough to pull it together, but I want to double-check that I'm not overlooking something nice and simple first! Are there any features in Cluster 2008 I'm overlooking that could accomplish this? And if not, do any of you fine folks have a script already to hand? In case it's not clear, the goal is to reboot the passive node, fail the cluster over to it, then reboot what was the active node.</p>

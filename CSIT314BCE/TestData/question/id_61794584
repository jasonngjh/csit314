<p>I'm doing a little project where there goal is to retrieve data in text format from a website. (<a href="http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html</a>)</p>

<p>The website was nice enough to provide it online but they sorted the data over several days in different links
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zz7nl.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zz7nl.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>I thought about looping through the dates and store the data with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>#Download the needed data

my_data &lt;- c()

for (i in 01:13){

my_data &lt;- read.delim(sprintf("http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol202005%i.txt", i), header=TRUE, sep="|")

}

head(my_data)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is that in line </p>

<pre><code>for (i in 01:13){ # The date in the website is 01-02-03 and the loop seems to ommit the 0
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/snIVL.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/snIVL.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>I've used the sprintf() method so I can have a variable in a string. </p>

<p>and this line the empty variable my_data always seems to be overwritten by the last data downloaded. </p>

<pre><code>my_data &lt;- read.delim(sprintf("http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol202005%i.txt", i), header=TRUE, sep="|")  
# the empty variable my_data always seems to be overwritten by the last data downloaded. 
</code></pre>

<p>Could somebody reassure me if i'm going in the right direction because i'm starting to doubt myself here</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated! </p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

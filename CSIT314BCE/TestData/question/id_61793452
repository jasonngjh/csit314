<p>I have two dataframe say A and B as below:</p>

<pre><code>A = [1,2,3,2,1,3]
B = [1,3,3,1,1,3]
</code></pre>

<p>I want to match each value of dataframe A  with B and count the matched value, for example there is total 2 rows with value 1 in same row, 0 rows with value 2 in same row and 2 rows with value 3 in same row.</p>

<pre><code>I want output as below:
Value - &gt; Count
1 -&gt; 2
2 -&gt; 0
3 -&gt; 2
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried the following code but it only displays true and false for matched rows.</p>

<pre><code>print(A.isin(B))
Output:
True
False
True
False
True
True
</code></pre>

<p>I tired using.count() and .value_count() but couldn't get the expected value. Someone teach me how to do it.</p>

<p>Heyo,</p>

<pre><code>set WshShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WScript.Sleep 5000
Do
WScript.Sleep(Random(11000, 30000, 1))
WshShell.SendKeys "p"
WScript.Sleep(Random(1000, 2000, 1))
WshShell.SendKeys "l"
WScript.Sleep(Random(1000, 2000, 1))
WshShell.SendKeys "s"
WScript.Sleep(Random(1000, 2000, 1))
WshShell.SendKeys " "
WScript.Sleep(Random(1000, 2000, 1))
WshShell.SendKeys "p"
WScript.Sleep(Random(1000, 2000, 1))
WshShell.SendKeys "m"
WScript.Sleep(Random(1000, 2000, 1))
WshShell.SendKeys "{ENTER}"
WScript.Sleep(Random(3000, 7000, 1))
WshShell.SendKeys "r"
Loop
</code></pre>

<p>This is my piece of script, but whenever I try to run it, it tells me that: random type mismatch, verse 4 , character 1. What is wrong with the random argument? I've tried to search for this problem in internet, but it seems to work for everyone.</p>

<p>No jQuery, only JS.</p>

<pre><code>var array1 = [
  {
    key1: '01',
    key2: 'abc',
    key3: 'def'
  },
  {
    key1: '02',
    key2: 'skip',
    key3: 'skip'
  },
  {
    key1: '03',
    key2: 'ghi',
    key3: 'jkl'
  },
];

var filters = ['ab', 'kl'];

function filter_by_part_of_string(array, filters) {
  return ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to get</p>

<pre><code>[
  {
    key1: '01',
    key2: 'abc',
    key3: 'def'
  },
  {
    key1: '03',
    key2: 'ghi',
    key3: 'jkl'
  },
];
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to filter by just part of string in value at any key. I tried search on stackoverflow, but most of answer i found was just filter by string but not a array and part of string.</p>

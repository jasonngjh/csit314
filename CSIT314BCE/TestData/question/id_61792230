<p>I want to create a program that gets all the .pdf-filenames (ex: test.pdf -> test) and creates an folder with that name. Also the foldername should be cropped after the first "-" (ex: A539B2AA3-GG-81234278 -> A539B2AA3).</p>

<p>This is the code I have made yet, but I have no clue how to proceed. I'm still a beginner, trying to learn C#: </p>

<pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>string path = @"C:\pdfs\";
string[] filenames;
int lengtharray;

filenames = Directory.GetFiles(path, "*", SearchOption.TopDirectoryOnly)
    .Where(s =&gt; (Path.GetExtension(s).ToLower() == ".pdf")).ToArray();

lengtharray = filenames.Length;
</code></pre>

<p>If someone can help me, I would be very happy.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
breadhead</p>

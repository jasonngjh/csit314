<p>I have drop-down list for currency.
I want to force USD option only on "add new product page" so people can only add the product in Dolar</p>

<p>Scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>User choose Euro on main page to show the prices in Euro.</li>
<li>User opened "Add new product page"</li>
<li>The drop-down list of the currency will shift to USD
automatically.</li>
</ol>

<p>How I can achive that in jqurey?</p>

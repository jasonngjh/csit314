<p>I have written routes to move files from a source directory to a destination directory using Camel. I need some help in moving these file data to a database. This is the route for moving files from one directory to another.</p>

<p>public class Camelroute extends RouteBuilder {</p>

<pre><code>    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
          copytextfiles();

    }
    public void copytextfiles()
    {
        from("file:input?include=.*\\.txt").to("file:output\\text");

    }
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

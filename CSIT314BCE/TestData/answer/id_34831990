<p>This is how a beginner wrapped one's head around Closures like a function is wrapped inside of a functions body also known as <strong>Closures</strong>.</p>

<p>Definition from the book Speaking JavaScript "A closure is a function plus the connection to the scope in which the function was created" -<em>Dr.Axel Rauschmayer</em></p>

<p>So what could that look like? Here is an example</p>

<pre><code>function newCounter() {
  var counter = 0;
   return function increment() {
    counter += 1;
   }
}

var counter1 = newCounter();
var counter2 = newCounter();

counter1(); // Number of events: 1
counter1(); // Number of events: 2
counter2(); // Number of events: 1
counter1(); // Number of events: 3
</code></pre>

<p><em>newCounter</em> closes over <em>increment</em>, <em>counter</em> can be referenced to and accessed by <em>increment</em>.</p>

<p><em>counter1</em> and <em>counter2</em> will keep track of their own value.</p>

<p>Simple but hopefully a clear perspective of what a closure is around all these great and advanced answers.</p>

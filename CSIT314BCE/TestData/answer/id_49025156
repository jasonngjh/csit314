<p>Here are many recipes how to undo things in Git. Some of them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh shit, I need to change the message on my last commit!</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>git commit --amend
# follow prompts to change the commit message
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh shit, I accidentally committed something to master that should have been on a brand new branch!</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code># Create a new branch from the current state of master
git branch some-new-branch-name
# Remove the commit from the master branch
git reset HEAD~ --hard
git checkout some-new-branch-name
# Your commit lives in this branch now :)
</code></pre>

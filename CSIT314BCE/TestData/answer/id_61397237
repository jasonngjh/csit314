<p>Google Maps is aware of the issue and working on a fix (<a href="https://twitter.com/JStheoriginal/status/1253415465243697161?s=08" rel="noreferrer">link</a>):</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://outage.report/google-maps" rel="noreferrer">outage.report</a>, google maps is having troubles at the time of these errors.  I suspect this is the cause of these errors.</p>

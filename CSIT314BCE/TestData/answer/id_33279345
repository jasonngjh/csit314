<p><strong>Pinocchio: Closures in 1883 (over a century before JavaScript)</strong></p>

<p>I think it can best be explained to a 6-year-old with a nice adventure... The part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Pinocchio" rel="noreferrer">Adventures of Pinocchio</a> where Pinocchio is being swallowed by an oversized dogfish...</p>

<p>Suppose you have an object that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var Hogwarts = {
    staff : [
        'Argus Filch',
        'Filius Flitwick',
        'Gilderoy Lockhart',
        'Minerva McGonagall',
        'Poppy Pomfrey',
        ...
    ],
    students : [
        'Hannah Abbott',
        'Katie Bell',
        'Susan Bones',
        'Terry Boot',
        'Lavender Brown',
        ...
    ]
};
</code></pre>

<h3>Deleting an object property</h3>

<p>If you want to use the entire <code>staff</code> array, the proper way to do this, would be to do this:</p>

<pre><code>delete Hogwarts.staff;
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could also do this:</p>

<pre><code>delete Hogwarts['staff'];
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, removing the entire students array would be done by calling <code>delete Hogwarts.students;</code> or <code>delete Hogwarts['students'];</code>.</p>

<h3>Deleting an array index</h3>

<p>Now, if you want to remove a single staff member or student, the procedure is a bit different, because both properties are arrays themselves.</p>

<p>If you know the index of your staff member, you could simply do this:</p>

<pre><code>Hogwarts.staff.splice(3, 1);
</code></pre>

<p>If you do not know the index, you'll also have to do an index search:</p>

<pre><code>Hogwarts.staff.splice(Hogwarts.staff.indexOf('Minerva McGonnagall') - 1, 1);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>While you technically can use <code>delete</code> for an array, using it would result in getting incorrect results when calling for example <code>Hogwarts.staff.length</code> later on. In other words, <code>delete</code> would remove the element, but it wouldn't update the value of <code>length</code> property. Using <code>delete</code> would also mess up your indexing.</p>

<p>So, when deleting values from an object, always first consider whether you're dealing with object properties or whether you're dealing with array values, and choose the appropriate strategy based on that.</p>

<p>There is also interactive mode:</p>

<pre><code>git add -i
</code></pre>

<p>Choose option 3 to un add files. In my case I often want to add more than one file, and with interactive mode you can use numbers like this to add files. This will take all but 4: 1, 2, 3, and 5</p>

<p>To choose a sequence, just type 1-5 to take all from 1 to 5.</p>

<pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1
</code></pre>

<p>Reset will rewind your current HEAD branch to the specified revision.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> the <code>--soft</code> flag: this makes sure that the changes in undone revisions are preserved. After running the command, you'll find the changes as uncommitted local modifications in your working copy.</p>

<p>If you don't want to keep these changes, simply use the <code>--hard</code> flag. Be sure to only do this when you're sure you don't need these changes anymore.</p>

<pre><code> git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>

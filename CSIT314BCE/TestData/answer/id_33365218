<p>Since you do not want to push the branch to a remote server, this example will be useful:</p>

<p>Let's say you have an existing branch called "my-hot-feature," and you want to rename it to "feature-15."</p>

<p>First, you want to change your local branch. This couldn't be easier:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -m my-hot-feature feature-15
</code></pre>

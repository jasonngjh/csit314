<p>I made this little diagram that shows how the data gets created and passed</p>

<p>Note: Primitive values are passed as a value, the first reference to to that value is the method's argument</p>

<p>That means:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can change the value of <code>myObject</code> <em>inside</em> the function</li>
<li>But you can't change what <code>myObject</code> references to, inside the function, because <code>point</code> is not <code>myObject</code></li>
<li>Remember, both <code>point</code> and <code>myObject</code> are <strong>references</strong>, different <strong>references</strong>, however, those references <strong>point</strong> at the same <code>new Point(0,0)</code></li>
</ul>

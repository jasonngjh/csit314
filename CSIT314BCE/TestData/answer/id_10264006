<p>Another answer you should put into consideration is if you are hiding an element, you should use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery" rel="noreferrer">jQuery</a>, but instead of actually hiding it, you remove the whole element, but you copy its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" rel="noreferrer">HTML</a> content and the tag itself into a jQuery variable, and then all you need to do is test if there is such a tag on the screen, using the normal <code>if (!$('#thetagname').length)</code>.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> have comments in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP" rel="noreferrer">JSONP</a>, but not in pure JSON. I've just spent an hour trying to make my program work with this example from Highcharts: <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/samples/data/jsonp.php?filename=aapl-c.json&amp;callback=?" rel="noreferrer">http://www.highcharts.com/samples/data/jsonp.php?filename=aapl-c.json&amp;callback=?</a></p>

<pre><code>?(/* AAPL historical OHLC data from the Google Finance API */

<p>Since I had a similar file in my local folder, there were no issues with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy" rel="noreferrer">Same-origin policy</a>, so I decided to use pure JSON... and, of course, <code>$.getJSON</code> was failing silently because of the comments.</p>

<p>Eventually I just sent a manual HTTP request to the address above and realized that the content-type was <code>text/javascript</code> since, well, JSONP returns pure JavaScript. In this case comments <em>are allowed</em>. But my application returned content-type <code>application/json</code>, so I had to remove the comments.</p>

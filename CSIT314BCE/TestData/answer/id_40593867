<p>The major cornerstone knowledge must be the quoted one,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When an object reference is passed to a method, the reference itself
  is passed by use of <em>call-by-value</em>. However, since the value being
  passed refers to an object, the copy of that value will still refer to
  the same object referred to by its corresponding argument.</p>

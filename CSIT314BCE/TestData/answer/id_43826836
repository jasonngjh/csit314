<p>Suppose you made a wrong commit locally and pushed it to a remote repository. You can undo the mess with these two commands:</p>

<p>First, we need to correct our local repository by going back to the commit that we desire:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard &lt;previous good commit id where you want the local repository  to go&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we forcefully push this good commit on the remote repository by using this command:</p>

<pre><code>git push --force-with-lease
</code></pre>

<p>The 'with-lease' version of the force option it will prevent accidental deletion of new commits you do not know about (i.e. coming from another source since your last pull).</p>

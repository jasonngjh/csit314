<p>I wrote a blog post a while back explaining closures. Here's what I said about closures in terms of <strong>why</strong> you'd want one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Closures are a way to let a function
  have <strong>persistent, private variables</strong> -
  that is, variables that only one
  function knows about, where it can
  keep track of info from previous times
  that it was run.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In that sense, they let a function act a bit like an object with private attributes.</p>

<p>Changing the branch <strong>locally</strong> is quite easy...</p>

<p>If you are on the branch you want to change the name for, simply do this:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -m my_new_branch
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, if you are on <code>master</code> or <strong>any other branch</strong> other than the one you'd like to change the name, simply do:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -m my_old_branch my_new_branch
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I create the image below to show this in action on a <strong>command line</strong>. In this case, you are on <code>master</code> branch, for example:</p>

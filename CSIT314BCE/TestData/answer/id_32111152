<p>To rename a branch locally:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -m [old-branch] [new-branch]
</code></pre>

<p>Now you'll have to propagate these changes on your remote server as well.</p>

<p>To push changes of the deleted old branch:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin :[old-branch]
</code></pre>

<p>To push changes of creation of new branch:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin [new-branch]
</code></pre>

<p>Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them
to throw errors.</p></li>
<li><p>fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript
engines to perform optimizations.</p></li>
<li><p>prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future
versions of ECMAScript.</p></li>
</ul>

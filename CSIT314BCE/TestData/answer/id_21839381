<p>How I'd explain it to a six-year-old:</p>

<p>You know how grown-ups can own a house, and they call it home? When a mom has a child, the child doesn't really own anything, right? But its parents own a house, so whenever someone asks the child "Where's your home?", he/she can answer "that house!", and point to the house of its parents. A "Closure" is the ability of the child to always (even if abroad) be able to say it has a home, even though it's really the parent's who own the house.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete" rel="noreferrer">delete operator</a> is the best way to do so.</p>

<p>A live example to show:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = {bar: 'bar'};
delete foo.bar;
console.log('bar' in foo); // Logs false, because bar was deleted from foo.
</code></pre>

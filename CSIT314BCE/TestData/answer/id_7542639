<p>Here's a way to avoid this vexing problem when you start a new project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create the main directory for your new project.</li>
<li>Run <code>git init</code>.</li>
<li>Now create a .gitignore file (even if it's empty).</li>
<li>Commit your .gitignore file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Git makes it really hard to do <code>git reset</code> if you don't have any commits.  If you create a tiny initial commit just for the sake of having one, after that you can <code>git add -A</code> and <code>git reset</code> as many times as you want in order to get everything right.</p>

<p>Another advantage of this method is that if you run into line-ending troubles later and need to refresh all your files, it's easy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check out that initial commit.  This will remove all your files.</li>
<li>Then check out your most recent commit again.  This will retrieve fresh copies of your files, using your current line-ending settings.</li>
</ul>

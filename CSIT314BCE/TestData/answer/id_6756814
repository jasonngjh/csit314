<p>You're having a sleep over and you invite Dan.
You tell Dan to bring one XBox controller.</p>

<p>Dan invites Paul.
Dan asks Paul to bring one controller. How many controllers were brought to the party?</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function sleepOver(howManyControllersToBring) {

    var numberOfDansControllers = howManyControllersToBring;

    return function danInvitedPaul(numberOfPaulsControllers) {
        var totalControllers = numberOfDansControllers + numberOfPaulsControllers;
        return totalControllers;
    }
}

var howManyControllersToBring = 1;

var inviteDan = sleepOver(howManyControllersToBring);

// The only reason Paul was invited is because Dan was invited. 
// So we set Paul's invitation = Dan's invitation.

var danInvitedPaul = inviteDan(howManyControllersToBring);

alert("There were " + danInvitedPaul + " controllers brought to the party.");

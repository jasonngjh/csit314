<p>As many already said you can use either "delete"(javascript property) or "unset"(using lodash).</p>

<p>You can also use lodash property "pick" to pick only necessary object properties.It will help when you get to delete multiple properties from the object.</p>

<p>Usage as below:</p>

<pre><code>var _   = require("lodash");
var obj = {"a":1, "b":2, "c":3};
obj = _.pick(obj,["a","b"]);    
//Now obj contains only 2 props {"a":1, "b":2}
</code></pre>

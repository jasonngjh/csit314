<p>I have a strange situation that neither <code>git clean</code> or <code>git reset</code> works. I have to remove the conflicting file from <code>git index</code> by using the following script on every untracked file:</p>

<pre><code>git rm [file]
</code></pre>

<p>Then I am able to pull just fine.</p>

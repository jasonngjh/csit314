<p>If you want to temporarily revert changes because</p>

<ul>
<li>someone committed code that is breaking the build or breaking the functionality you're working on</li>
</ul>

<p>You can search for the last working commit using <code>git log</code> and then run:</p>

<pre><code>git rebase --onto &lt;commitId&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When the remote branch is working again, you can</p>

<pre><code>git pull --rebase
</code></pre>

<p>This method is better than <code>git checkout</code> for temporary changes, because you're not in a detached state.</p>

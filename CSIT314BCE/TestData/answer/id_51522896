<h2>Java passes primitive types by value and class types by reference</h2>

<p>Now, people like to bicker endlessly about whether "pass by reference" is the correct way to describe what Java et al. actually do. The point is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Passing an object does not copy the object.</li>
<li>An object passed to a function can have its members modified by the function.</li>
<li>A primitive value passed to a function cannot be modified by the function. A copy is made.</li>
</ol>

<p>In my book that's called passing by reference.</p>

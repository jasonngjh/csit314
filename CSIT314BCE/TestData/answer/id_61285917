<p>Python set an unordered collection which do not record element position or order of insertion. There is no index attached to any element in a python set. So they do not support any indexing or slicing operation. </p>

<p>So don't expect your for loop will work in a defined order.</p>

<p><strong>Why does it do 16 iterations?</strong></p>

<p><code>user2357112 supports Monica</code> already explains the main cause. Here, is another way of thinking.</p>

<pre><code>s = {0}
for i in s:
     s.add(i + 1)
     print(s)
     s.remove(i)
print(s)
</code></pre>

<p>When you run this code it gives you output this :</p>

<p>When we access all the elements together like loop or printing the set, there must be a predefined order for it to traverse the whole set.
So, in last iteration you will see order is changed like from <code>{i,i+1}</code> to <code>{i+1,i}</code>.</p>

<p>After the last iteration it happened that <code>i+1</code> is already traversed so loop exit.</p>

<p><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong>
Use any value less than 16 except 6 and 7 will always gives you result 16. </p>

<p><strong>HEAD:</strong></p>

<p>Before reset commit we should know about HEAD... HEAD is nothing but your current state in your working directory. It is represented by a commit number.</p>

<p><strong>Git commit:</strong></p>

<p>Each change assigned under a commit which is represented by a unique tag. Commits can't be deleted. So if you want your last commit, you can simply dive into it using <code>git reset</code>.</p>

<p>You can dive into the last commit using two methods:</p>

<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> (if you don't know the commit number, but want to move onto the very first)</p>

<pre><code>git reset HEAD~1  # It will move your head to last commit
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> (if you know the commit you simply reset onto your known commit)</p>

<p><code>git reset 0xab3</code> # Commit number</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you want to know a recent commit try <code>git log -p -1</code></p>

<p>Here is the graphical representation:</p>

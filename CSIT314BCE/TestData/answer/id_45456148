<p>You can undo your Git commits in two ways:
First is you can use <code>git revert</code>, if you want to keep your commit history:</p>

<pre><code>git revert HEAD~3
git revert &lt;hashcode of commit&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Second is you can use <code>git reset</code>, which would delete all your commit history and bring your head to commit where you want it.</p>

<pre><code>git reset &lt;hashcode of commit&gt;
git reset HEAD~3
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use the <code>--hard</code> keyword if any of it starts behaving otherwise. But, I would only recommend it until it's extremely necessary.</p>

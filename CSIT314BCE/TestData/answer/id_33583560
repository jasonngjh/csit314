<p>As many answers have already pointed out, JSON does not natively have comments. Of course sometimes you want them anyway. For <strong>Python</strong>, two ways to do that are with <a href="https://github.com/vaidik/commentjson" rel="noreferrer"><code>commentjson</code></a> (<code>#</code> and <code>//</code> for Python&nbsp;2 only) or <a href="https://github.com/mverleg/pyjson_tricks" rel="noreferrer"><code>json_tricks</code></a> (<code>#</code> or <code>//</code> for Python&nbsp;2 and Python&nbsp;3), which has several other features. Disclaimer: I made <code>json_tricks</code>.</p>

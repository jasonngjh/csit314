<h2>This is one more way to directly reset to a recent commit</h2>

<pre><code>git stash
git stash clear
</code></pre>

<p>It directly clears all the changes that you have been making since the last commit.</p>

<p>PS: It has a little problem; it also deletes all you recently stored stash changes. Which I guess in most cases should not matter.</p>

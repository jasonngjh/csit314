<p><strong>To delete <em>locally</em> - (normal)</strong></p>

<pre><code>git branch -d my_branch
</code></pre>

<p>If your branch is in a rebasing/merging progress and that was not done properly, it means you will get an error, <code>Rebase/Merge in progress</code>, so in that case, you won't be able to delete your branch.</p>

<p>So either you need to solve the rebasing/merging. Otherwise, you can do force <em>delete</em> by using,</p>

<pre><code>git branch -D my_branch
</code></pre>

<p><strong>To delete in <em>remote</em>:</strong></p>

<pre><code>git push --delete origin my_branch
</code></pre>

<p><strong>You can do the same using:</strong></p>

<pre><code>git push origin :my_branch   # Easy to remember both will do the same.
</code></pre>

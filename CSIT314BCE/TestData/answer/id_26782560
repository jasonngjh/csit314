<p>For anyone looking for a Windows/Mac GUI to help with editing older messages (i.e. not just the latest message), I'd recommend <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sourcetree</a>. The steps to follow are below.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CcA2P.png" alt="Sourcetree interactive rebase"></p>

<p><strong>For commits that haven't yet been pushed to a remote:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you've committed or stashed all current changes (i.e., so there are no files listed in the "File Status" tab) - it won't work otherwise.</li>
<li>In the "Log / History" tab, right click on the entry with an adjoining line in the graph <strong>one below</strong> the commit(s) you wish to edit and select "Rebase children of <em>&lt;commit ref&gt;</em> interactively..."</li>
<li>Select the whole row for a commit message you wish to change (<em>i.e., click on the "Message" column</em>).</li>
<li>Click the "Edit Message" button.</li>
<li>Edit the message as desired in the dialog that comes up and then click <kbd>OK</kbd>.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3-4 if there are other commit messages to change.</li>
<li>Click <kbd>OK</kbd>: Rebasing will commence. If all is well, the output will end "Completed successfully". <strong><em>NOTE:</strong> I've recently seen it fail with <code>Unable to create 'project_path/.git/index.lock': File exists.</code> when trying to modify multiple commit messages at the same time. Not sure exactly what the issue is, or whether it will be fixed in a future version of Sourcetree, but if this happens would recommend rebasing them one at a time (slower but seems more reliable).</em></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>...Or... for commits that have already been pushed:</strong></p>

<p>Follow the steps in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17604232#23239109">this answer</a>, which are similar to above, but require a further command to be run from the command line (<code>git push origin &lt;branch&gt; -f</code>) to force-push the branch. I would recommend reading it all and applying the necessary caution!</p>

<p>If you are using the Newtonsoft.Json library with ASP.NET to read/deserialize you can use comments in the JSON content:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>//"name": "string"</p>
  
  <p>//"id": int</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>/* This is a</p>
  
  <p>comment example */</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> Single-line comments are only supported with 6+ versions of Newtonsoft Json.</p>

<p><strong>Additional note for people who can't think out of the box:</strong> I use the JSON format for basic settings in an ASP.NET web application I made. I read the file, convert it into the settings object with the Newtonsoft library and use it when necessary.</p>

<p>I prefer writing comments about each individual setting in the JSON file itself, and I really don't care about the integrity of the JSON format as long as the library I use is OK with it.</p>

<p>I think this is an 'easier to use/understand' way than creating a separate 'settings.README' file and explaining the settings in it.</p>

<p>If you have a problem with this kind of usage; sorry, the genie is out of the lamp. People would find other usages for JSON format, and there is nothing you can do about it.</p>

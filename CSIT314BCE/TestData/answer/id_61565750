<p>The reason this happens is because <strong>moment</strong> has released the new version from <strong>2.24.0 to 2.25.0</strong></p>

<p><strong>Perform the following Steps to solve this issue :</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>change the versions</strong> (In your case just add the <strong>"moment":"2.24.0"</strong> to your dependencies in your <strong>package.json</strong> since I don't see it present in your package.json)</p>

<pre><code>"moment": "2.24.0",
"moment-timezone": "^0.5.28",
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you are using <strong>yarn</strong> please add resolutions in your package.json file like this</p>

<pre><code>"dependencies" {
"moment": "2.24.0",
"moment-timezone": "^0.5.28"
},
"resolutions": {
"moment": "2.24.0"
},
</code></pre>

<h2>Functions containing no free variables are called pure functions.</h2>

<h2>Functions containing one or more free variables are called closures.</h2>

<pre><code>var pure = function pure(x){
  return x 
  // only own environment is used
}

var foo = "bar"

var closure = function closure(){
  return foo
  // foo is free variable from the outer environment
}
</code></pre>

<p>All branches are stored in <code>.git/refs</code><br>
All local branches are stored in <code>.git/refs/heads</code><br>
All remote branches are stored in <code>.git/refs/remotes</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>git fetch</code> command downloads commits, files, and refs from a
  remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when
  you want to see what everybody else has been working on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when you do <code>git fetch</code> all the files, commits,and  refs are downloaded in this <code>.git/refs/remotes</code>
You can switch to these branches to see the changes.
You can merge them if you want.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>git pull</code>  just downloads these changes and also merges them to the
  current branch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Example</em><br>
If you want see the work of remote branch <code>dev/jd/feature/auth</code>, you just need to do <br> <code>git fetch origin dev/jd/feature/auth</code>.<br>
Now do, <br><code>git checkout dev/jd/feature/auth</code> <br>to see the changes or work progress.<br><br>
<em>If you do <code>git fetch origin</code>, it will fetch all the branches, now you can switch to whatever you want. Your local master or other local branches won't be affected.</em></p>

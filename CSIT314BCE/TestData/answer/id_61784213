<p>The least fixed point of a functor <em>F</em> is the initial algebra for <em>F</em>, that is, the initial object in the category of <em>F</em>-algebras defined by the functor. We can define an order on the algebras where <code>c &lt;= d</code> if there is a morphism from <code>c</code> to <code>d</code>. By the definition of an initial object, there is a morphism from the initial algebra to every other algebra. That makes the initial algebra the "least" element of the defined ordering.</p>

<p>Likewise, the greatest fixed point of <em>F</em> is the terminal coalgebra for <em>F</em>. A similar argument makes it the largest element in the ordering induced by morphisms in the category of <em>F</em>-coalgebras.</p>

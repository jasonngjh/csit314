<p>Sigh. Why not just add fields, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>{
    "note1" : "This demonstrates the provision of annotations within a JSON file",
    "field1" : 12,
    "field2" : "some text",

    "note2" : "Add more annotations as necessary"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just make sure your "notex" names don't conflict with any real fields.</p>

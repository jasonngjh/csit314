<p>This is how I use it.</p>

<pre><code>   window.location.replace('yourPage.aspx');   
   // If you're on root and redirection page is also on the root

   window.location.replace(window.location.host + '/subDirectory/yourPage.aspx');

   // If you're in sub directory and redirection page is also in some other sub directory.
</code></pre>

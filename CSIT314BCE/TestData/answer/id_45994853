<p>Git branch rename can be done by using:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>git branch -m oldBranch newBranch</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>git branch -M oldBranch ExistingBranch</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>The difference between <strong>-m</strong> and <strong>-M</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>-m:</strong> if you're trying to rename your branch with an existing branch name using <strong>-m</strong>.
It will raise an error saying that the branch already exists. You need to give unique name.</p>

<p>But,</p>

<p><strong>-M:</strong> this will help you to force rename with a given name, even it is exists. So an existing branch will overwrite entirely with it...</p>

<p>Here is a <strong>Git terminal example,</strong></p>

<pre><code>mohideen@dev:~/project/myapp/sunithamakeup$ git branch
  master
  master0
  new_master
  test
* test1
mohideen@dev:~/project/myapp/sunithamakeup$ git branch -m test1 test
fatal: A branch named 'test' already exists.
mohideen@dev:~/project/myapp/sunithamakeup$ git branch -M test1 test
mohideen@dev:~/project/myapp/sunithamakeup$ git branch
  master
  master0
  new_master
* test
mohideen@dev:~/project/myapp/sunithamakeup$
</code></pre>

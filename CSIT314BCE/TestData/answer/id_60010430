<p>If the array contains duplicate values and you want to remove all the occurrences of your target then this is the way to go...</p>

<pre><code>let data = [2, 5, 9, 2, 8, 5, 9, 5];
let target = 5;
data = data.filter(da =&gt; da !== target);
</code></pre>

<p>Note: - the filter doesn't change the original array; instead it creates a new array.</p>

<p>So assigning again is important.</p>

<p>That's led to another problem. You can't make the variable <code>const</code>. It should be <code>let</code> or <code>var</code>.</p>

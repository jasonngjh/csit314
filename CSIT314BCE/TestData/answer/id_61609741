<p>New moment 2.25.x versions have been released and the latest version should fix this issue.</p>

<p>It seems like the version <a href="https://github.com/moment/moment/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#2252" rel="nofollow noreferrer">2.25.2</a> was addressing this issue. So a downgrade to 2.24.0 is not required anymore.</p>

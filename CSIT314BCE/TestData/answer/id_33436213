<blockquote>
  <p>Let's assume our work on branch "contact-form" is done and we've already integrated it into "master". Since we don't need it anymore, we can delete it (locally):</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch -d contact-form
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>And for deleting the remote branch:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin --delete contact-form
</code></pre>

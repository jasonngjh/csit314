<p>This is still guaranteed by <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/expr.rel#4.2" rel="noreferrer">[expr.rel]/(4.2)</a>, describing the behavior of built-in <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>&gt;=</code> expressions on pointer values.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If two pointers point to different non-static data members of the same object, or to subobjects of such members, recursively, the pointer to the later declared member is required to compare greater provided the two members have the same access control ([class.access]), neither member is a subobject of zero size, and their class is not a union.</p>

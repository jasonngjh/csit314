<p>A simple generator function</p>

<pre><code>def my_gen():
    n = 1
    print('This is printed first')
    # Generator function contains yield statements
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed second')
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed at last')
    yield n
</code></pre>

<p>yield statement pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls.</p>

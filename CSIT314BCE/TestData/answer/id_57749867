<p>You can use either dot notation or bracket notation</p>

<pre><code>//Bracket notation 
//its direct approach when you know the exact value which you want to remove
delete myObject.regex;


//Dot Notation 
//its dynamic approach when you don't know which value you want to remove at the point of code
delete myObject['regex'];
</code></pre>

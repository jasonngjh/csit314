<p>I couldn't revert mine manually for some reason so here is how I ended up doing it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Checked out the branch I wanted to have, copied it.</li>
<li>Checked out the latest branch.</li>
<li>Copied the contents from the branch I wanted to the latest branch's directory overwriting the changes and committing that.</li>
</ol>

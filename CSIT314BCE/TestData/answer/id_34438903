<h3>Bonus:</h3>

<p>In speaking of pull &amp; fetch in the above answers, I would like to share an interesting trick,</p>

<h1><strong><code>git pull --rebase</code></strong></h1>

<p>This above command is the most useful command in my git life which saved a lots of time.</p>

<p>Before pushing your new commits to server, try this command and it will automatically sync latest server changes (with a fetch + merge) and will place your commit at the top in git log. No need to worry about manual pull/merge.</p>

<p>I got sick of googling for this answer, so I took a similar approach to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/15775364/551436">the answer that crizCraig posted</a> earlier.</p>

<p>I added the following to my Bash profile:</p>

<pre><code>function gitdelete(){
    git push origin --delete $1
    git branch -D $1
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then every time I'm done with a branch (merged into <code>master</code>, for example) I run the following in my terminal:</p>

<pre><code>gitdelete my-branch-name
</code></pre>

<p>...which then deletes <code>my-branch-name</code> from <code>origin</code> as as well as locally.</p>

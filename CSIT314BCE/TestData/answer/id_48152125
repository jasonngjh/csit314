<p>I have had a similar issue and wanted to revert back to an earlier commit. In my case I was not interested to keep the newer commit, hence I used <code>Hard</code>.</p>

<p>This is how I did it:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard CommitId &amp;&amp; git clean -f
</code></pre>

<p>This will revert on the local repository, and here after using <code>git push -f</code> will update the remote repository.</p>

<pre><code>git push -f
</code></pre>

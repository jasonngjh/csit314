<p>Wow, so there are a lot of ways to do this.</p>

<p>Yet another way to do this is to delete the last commit, but keep its changes so that you won't lose your work. You can then do another commit with the corrected message. This would look something like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1
git commit -m 'New and corrected commit message'
</code></pre>

<p>I always do this if I forget to add a file or do a change.</p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong> to specify <code>--soft</code> instead of <code>--hard</code>, otherwise you lose that commit entirely.</p>

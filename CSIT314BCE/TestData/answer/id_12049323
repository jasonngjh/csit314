<p>Working on your own and just want it to work? Follow these instructions below, theyâ€™ve worked reliably for me and many others for years.</p>

<p>Working with others? Git is complicated. Read the comments below this answer before you do something rash.</p>

<h3>Reverting Working Copy to Most Recent Commit</h3>

<p>To revert to a previous commit, ignoring any changes:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>where HEAD is the last commit in your current branch</p>

<h3>Reverting The Working Copy to an Older Commit</h3>

<p>To revert to a commit that's older than the most recent commit:</p>

<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code># Resets index to former commit; replace '56e05fced' with your commit code
git reset 56e05fced 

# Moves pointer back to previous HEAD
git reset --soft HEAD@{1}

git commit -m "Revert to 56e05fced"

# Updates working copy to reflect the new commit
git reset --hard
</code></pre>

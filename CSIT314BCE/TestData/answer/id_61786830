<p><strong>Everyone explained why it is wrong but no-one showed you how to fix it.</strong> </p>

<p>Here is how you fix your code so that it works </p>

<pre><code>pi_approx :: Int -&gt; Double
pi_approx x = let total = sum [1 /(fromIntegral (y^2)) | y &lt;- [1..x]]
    in sqrt (6 * total)
</code></pre>

<p>once you add in <code>fromIntegral</code> the type checker will be satisfied. As was explained by the other users the type of the function <code>/</code> wasn't being satisfied. </p>

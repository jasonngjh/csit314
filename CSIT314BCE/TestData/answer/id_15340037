<p>If you want to explain it to a six-year old child then you must find something very much simpler and NO code.</p>

<p>Just tell the child that he is "open", which says that he is able to have relations with some others, his friends. At some point in time, he has determined friends (we can know the names of his friends), that is a closure. If you take a picture of him and his friends then he is "closed" relatively to his friendship ability. But in general, he is "open". During his whole life he will have many different sets of friends. One of these sets is a closure.</p>

<p>If you are using Ubuntu or Debian and you serve .json files through Apache, you might want to serve the files with the correct content type. I am doing this primarily because I want to use the Firefox extension <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10869/">JSONView</a></p>

<p>The Apache module <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_mime.html">mod_mime</a> will help to do this easily. However, with Ubuntu you need to edit the file <em>/etc/mime.types</em> and add the line</p>

<pre><code>application/json json
</code></pre>

<p>Then restart Apache:</p>

<pre><code>sudo service apache2 restart
</code></pre>

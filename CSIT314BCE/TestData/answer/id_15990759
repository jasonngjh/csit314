<p><strong>Briefly</strong></p>

<p><code>git fetch</code> is similar to <code>pull</code> but doesn't merge. i.e. it fetches remote updates (<code>refs</code> and <code>objects</code>) but your local stays the same (i.e. <code>origin/master</code> gets updated but <code>master</code> stays the same) .</p>

<p><code>git pull</code> pulls down from a remote and instantly merges.</p>

<p><strong>More</strong></p>

<p><code>git clone</code> clones a repo.</p>

<p><code>git rebase</code> saves stuff from your current branch that isn't in the upstream branch to a temporary area. Your branch is now the same as before you started your changes. So, <code>git pull -rebase</code> will pull down the remote changes, rewind your local branch, replay your changes over the top of your current branch one by one until you're up-to-date.</p>

<p>Also, <code>git branch -a</code> will show you exactly whatâ€™s going on with all your branches - local and remote.</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>I thought I'd update this to show how you'd actually use this in practice. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Update your local repo from the remote (but don't merge):</p>

<pre><code>git fetch 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>After downloading the updates, let's see the differences:</p>

<pre><code>git diff master origin/master 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you're happy with those updates, then merge:</p>

<pre><code>git pull
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>On step 2: For more on diffs between local and remotes, see: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1800783/compare-local-git-branch-with-remote-branch">How to compare a local git branch with its remote branch?</a></p>

<p>On step 3: It's probably more accurate (e.g. on a fast changing repo) to do a <code>git rebase origin</code> here.

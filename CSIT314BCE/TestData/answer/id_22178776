<p>If you want to "uncommit", erase the last commit message, and put the modified files back in staging, you would use the command:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>--soft</code> indicates that the uncommitted files should be retained as working files opposed to <code>--hard</code> which would discard them.</li>
<li><code>HEAD~1</code> is the last commit.  If you want to rollback 3 commits you could use <code>HEAD~3</code>.  If you want to rollback to a specific revision number, you could also do that using its SHA hash.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an extremely useful command in situations where you committed the wrong thing and you want to undo that last commit.</p>

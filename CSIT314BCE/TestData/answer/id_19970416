<p>The Java programming language passes arguments only by value, that is,
you cannot change the argument value in the calling method from within
the called method.</p>

<hr>

<p>However, when an object instance is passed as an argument to a method,
the value of the argument is not the object itself but a reference to the
object. You can change the contents of the object in the called method but
not the object reference.</p>

<hr>

<p>To many people, this looks like pass-by-reference, and behaviorally, it has
much in common with pass-by-reference. However, there are two reasons
this is inaccurate.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, the ability to change the thing passed into a
method only applies to objects, not primitive values. </p></li>
<li><p>Second, the actual
value associated with a variable of object type is the reference to the
object, and not the object itself. This is an important distinction in other
ways, and if clearly understood, is entirely supporting of the point that
the Java programming language passes arguments by value.</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>The following code example illustrates this point:
1 public class PassTest {
2
3   // Methods to change the current values
4   public static void changeInt(int value) {
5     value = 55;
6  }
7   public static void changeObjectRef(MyDate ref) {
8     ref = new MyDate(1, 1, 2000);
9  }
10   public static void changeObjectAttr(MyDate ref) {
11     ref.setDay(4);
12   }
13
14 public static void main(String args[]) {
15     MyDate date;
16     int val;
17
18     // Assign the int
19     val = 11;
20     // Try to change it
21     changeInt(val);
22     // What is the current value?
23     System.out.println("Int value is: " + val);
24
25 // Assign the date
26     date = new MyDate(22, 7, 1964);
27     // Try to change it
28     changeObjectRef(date);
29     // What is the current value?
30 System.out.println("MyDate: " + date);
31
32 // Now change the day attribute
33     // through the object reference
34     changeObjectAttr(date);
35     // What is the current value?
36 System.out.println("MyDate: " + date);
37   }
38 }

<hr>

<pre><code>This code outputs the following:
java PassTest
Int value is: 11
MyDate: 22-7-1964
MyDate: 4-7-1964
The MyDate object is not changed by the changeObjectRef method;
however, the changeObjectAttr method changes the day attribute of the
MyDate object.

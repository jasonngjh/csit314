<p>If you want to correct some error in the last commit a good alternative would be using <strong>git commit --amend</strong> command. If the last commit is not pointed by any reference, this will do the trick, as it create a commit with the same parent as the last commit. If there is no reference to the last commit, it will simply be discarded and this commit will be the last commit. This is a good way of correcting commits without reverting commits. However it has its own limitations. </p>

<p>Probably as mentioned by others, this will be a case mismatch in branch naming.</p>

<p>If you have such a situation, I can guess that you're on Windows which will also lead you to:</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch -m CaseSensitive casesensitive
fatal: A branch named 'casesensitive' already exists.
</code></pre>

<p>Then you have to do an intermediate step:</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch -m temporary
$ git branch -m casesensitive
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing more.</p>

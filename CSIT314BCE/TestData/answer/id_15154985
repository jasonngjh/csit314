<p>If the branch is on something other than the <code>origin</code> remote I like to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch
$ git checkout -b second/next upstream/next
</code></pre>

<p>This will checkout the <code>next</code> branch on the <code>upstream</code> remote in to a local branch called <code>second/next</code>. Which means if you already have a local branch named next it will not conflict.</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch -a
* second/next
  remotes/origin/next
  remotes/upstream/next
</code></pre>

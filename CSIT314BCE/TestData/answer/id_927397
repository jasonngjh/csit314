<p>Add/remove files to get things the way you want:</p>

<pre><code>git rm classdir
git add sourcedir
</code></pre>

<p>Then amend the commit:</p>

<pre><code>git commit --amend
</code></pre>

<p>The previous, erroneous commit will be edited to reflect the new index state - in other words, it'll be like you never made the mistake in the first place.</p>

<p>Note that you should only do this if you haven't pushed yet. If you have pushed, then you'll just have to commit a fix normally.</p>

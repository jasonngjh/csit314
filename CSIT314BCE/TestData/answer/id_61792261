<p>This is because of copy elision/named return value optimization (NRVO). <code>foo</code> returns a named object <code>a</code>. So the compiler is not creating a local object and returning a copy of it but creates the object at the place where the caller puts it. You can read more about it on <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision" rel="noreferrer">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision</a>.</p>

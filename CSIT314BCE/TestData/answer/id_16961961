<p><code>git branch -r</code> says the object name is invalid, because that branch name isn't in Git's local branch list. Update your local branch list from origin with:</p>

<pre><code>git remote update
</code></pre>

<p>And then try checking out your remote branch again.</p>

<p>This worked for me.</p>

<p>I believe <code>git fetch</code> pulls in <em>all</em> remote branches, which is not what the original poster wanted.</p>

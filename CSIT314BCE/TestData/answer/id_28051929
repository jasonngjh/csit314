<p>Let's look at the answer in a more abstract way:</p>

<p>Suppose we have this code in x.py:</p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;Block A&gt;
if __name__ == '__main__':
    &lt;Block B&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>Blocks A and B are run when we are running "x.py".</p>

<p>But just block A (and not B) is run when we are running another module, "y.py" for example, in which x.y is imported and the code is run from there (like when a function in "x.py" is called from y.py).</p>

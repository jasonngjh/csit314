<p><em>Also...</em>  Perhaps we should cut your 27-year-old friend a little <em>slack,</em> because the entire concept of "closures" really <strong>is(!)</strong> ... <em>voodoo!</em> </p>

<p>By that I mean: <em>(a)</em> you do not, intuitively, expect it ...AND... <em>(b)</em> when someone takes the time to explain it to you, you certainly do not expect it to <em>work!</em></p>

<p>Intuition tells you that "this must be nonsense... <em>surely</em> it must result in some kind of syntax-error or something!"  <em>How on earth(!)</em> could you, in effect, "pull a function from 'the middle of' wherever-it's-at," such that you could [still!] actually have read/write access to the context of "wherever-it-<em>was</em>-at?!"</p>

<p>When you finally realize that such a thing is <em>possible,</em> then ... sure ... anyone's <em>after-the-fact</em> reaction would be: "whoa-a-a-a(!)... kew-el-l-l-l...(!!!)"</p>

<p>But there will be a "big counter-intuitive hurdle" to overcome, first.  Intuition gives you plenty of utterly-plausible expectations that such a thing would be "of <em>course,</em> absolutely nonsensical and therefore quite impossible."</p>

<p>Like I said: "it's voodoo."</p>

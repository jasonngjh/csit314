<p>The browser is trying to convert <code>chucknorris</code> into hex colour code, because it's not a valid value. </p>

<ol>
<li>In <code>chucknorris</code>, everything except <strong><code>c</code></strong> is not a valid hex value.</li>
<li>So it gets converted to <strong><code>c00c00000000</code></strong>. </li>
<li>Which becomes <strong>#c00000</strong>, a shade of red.</li>
</ol>

<p>This seems to be an issue primarily with <strong>Internet&nbsp;Explorer</strong> and <strong>Opera</strong> (12) as both Chrome (31) and Firefox (26) just ignore this.</p>

<p><em>P.S. The numbers in brackets are the browser versions I tested on.</em></p>

<p>.</p>

<p>On a lighter note</p>

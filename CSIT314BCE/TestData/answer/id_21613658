<p>If you are using <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson" rel="noreferrer">Jackson</a> as your JSON parser then this is how you enable it to allow comments:</p>

<pre><code>ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper().configure(Feature.ALLOW_COMMENTS, true);
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can have comments like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  key: "value" // Comment
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you can also have comments starting with <code>#</code> by setting:</p>

<pre><code>mapper.configure(Feature.ALLOW_YAML_COMMENTS, true);
</code></pre>

<p>But in general (as answered before) the specification does not allow comments.</p>

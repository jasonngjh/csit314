<p>For a six-year-old?</p>

<p>You and your family live in the mythical town of Ann Ville. You have a friend who lives next door, so you call them and ask them to come out and play. You dial:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>000001 (jamiesHouse)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a month, you and your family move out of Ann Ville to the next town, but you and your friend still keep in touch, so now you have to dial the area code for the town that your friend lives in, before dialling their 'proper' number:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>001 000001 (annVille.jamiesHouse)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A year after that, your parents move to a whole new country, but you and your friend still keep in touch, so after bugging your parents to let you make international rate calls, you now dial:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>01 001 000001 (myOldCountry.annVille.jamiesHouse)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strangely though, after moving to your new country, you and your family just so happen to move to a new town called Ann Ville... and you just so happen to make friends with some new person called Jamie... You give them a call...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>000001 (jamiesHouse)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spooky...</p>

<p>So spooky in fact, that you tell Jamie from your old country about it... You have a good laugh about it. So one day, you and your family take a holiday back to the old country. You visit your old town (Ann Ville), and go to visit Jamie...</p>

<ul>
<li>"Really? Another Jamie? In Ann Ville? In your new country!!?"</li>
<li>"Yeah... Let's call them..."</li>
</ul>

<p>Opinions?</p>

<p><em>What's more, I have a load of questions about the patience of a modern six-year-old...</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The stack is essentially an easy-to-access memory that simply manages its items 
  as a - well - stack. Only <strong>items for which the size is known in advance can go onto the stack</strong>. This is the case for numbers, strings, booleans.</p>
  
  <p>The <strong>heap is a memory for items of which you canâ€™t predetermine the
  exact size and structure</strong>. Since objects and arrays can be mutated and
  change at runtime, they have to go into the heap.</p>

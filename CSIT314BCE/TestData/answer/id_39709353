<p>Java does manipulate objects by reference, and all object variables are references. However, Java doesn't pass method arguments by reference; it passes them by value.</p>

<p>Take the badSwap() method for example:</p>

<pre><code>    public void badSwap(int var1, int
 var2{ int temp = var1; var1 = var2; var2 =
 temp; }
</code></pre>

<p>When badSwap() returns, the variables passed as arguments will still hold their original values. The method will also fail if we change the arguments type from int to Object, since Java passes object references by value as well. Now, here is where it gets tricky:</p>

<pre><code>public void tricky(Point arg1, Point   arg2)
{ arg1.x = 100; arg1.y = 100; Point temp = arg1; arg1 = arg2; arg2 = temp; }
public static void main(String [] args) { 

 Point pnt1 = new Point(0,0); Point pnt2
 = new Point(0,0); System.out.println("X:
 " + pnt1.x + " Y: " +pnt1.y);

     System.out.println("X: " + pnt2.x + " Y:
 " +pnt2.y); System.out.println(" ");

     tricky(pnt1,pnt2);
 System.out.println("X: " + pnt1.x + " Y:" + pnt1.y);

     System.out.println("X: " + pnt2.x + " Y: " +pnt2.y); }
</code></pre>

<p>If we execute this main() method, we see the following output:</p>

<p>X: 0 Y: 0 X: 0 Y: 0 X: 100 Y: 100 X: 0 Y: 0</p>

<p>The method successfully alters the value ofpnt1, even though it is passed by value; however, a swap of pnt1 and pnt2 fails! This is the major source of confusion. In themain() method, pnt1 and pnt2 are nothing more than object references. When you passpnt1 and pnt2 to the tricky() method, Java passes the references by value just like any other parameter. This means the references passed to the method are actually copies of the original references. Figure 1 below shows two references pointing to the same object after Java passes an object to a method.</p>

<p>Java copies and passes the reference by value, not the object. Thus, method manipulation will alter the objects, since the references point to the original objects. But since the references are copies, swaps will fail. As Figure 2 illustrates, the method references swap, but not the original references. Unfortunately, after a method call, you are left with only the unswapped original references. For a swap to succeed outside of the method call, we need to swap the original references, not the copies.</p>

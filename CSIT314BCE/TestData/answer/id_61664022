<p>The <code>sizeof</code> is an operator, not a function, and as any operator it has a precedence, which is in C lower than of the <code>++</code> operator. Therefore the construct <code>sizeof(a)++</code> is equivalent to <code>sizeof a++</code> which is in turn equivalent to <code>sizeof (a++)</code>. Here we have postincrement on <code>a</code> which is an lvalue so it is perfectly legal. If instead of <code>a</code> you have <code>3</code> which is not lvalue, the compilation will fail.</p>

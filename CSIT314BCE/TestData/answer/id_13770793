<p>While the first and selected answer is technically <em>correct</em>, there's the possibility you have not yet retrieved all objects and refs from the remote repository. If that is the case, you'll receive the following error:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b remote_branch origin/remote_branch
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>fatal: git checkout: updating paths is incompatible with switching branches.<br>
  Did you intend to checkout 'origin/remote_branch' which can not be resolved as commit?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>If you receive this message, you must first do a <code>git fetch origin</code> where <code>origin</code> is the name of the remote repository prior to running <code>git checkout remote_branch</code>. Here's a full example with responses:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch origin
remote: Counting objects: 140, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (30/30), done.
remote: Total 69 (delta 36), reused 66 (delta 33)
Unpacking objects: 100% (69/69), done.

   e6ef1e0..5029161  develop    -&gt; origin/develop
 * [new branch]      demo       -&gt; origin/demo
   d80f8d7..359eab0  master     -&gt; origin/master

$ git checkout demo
Branch demo set up to track remote branch demo from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'demo'
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, running <code>git fetch origin</code> retrieved any remote branches we were not yet setup to track on our local machine. From there, since we now have a ref to the remote branch, we can simply run <code>git checkout remote_branch</code> and we'll gain the benefits of remote tracking.</p>

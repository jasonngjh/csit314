<p>I was trying to use the Material2 branch on the Angular2-Webpack-Starter and had a heck of a time. This was the only way I could download and use that branch.</p>

<pre><code>git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/angularclass/angular2-webpack-starter.git

cd angular2-webpack-starter/

git checkout -b material2
</code></pre>

<p>Open the project folder and delete all non-hidden files and folders. Leave all the hidden ones.</p>

<pre><code>git add .

git commit -m "pokemon go"

git reset --hard

git pull origin material2
</code></pre>

<p>(When the editor pops up, hit ':wq', and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>)</p>

<p>Now you are ready.</p>

<p>JavaScript is very extensive. If you want to jump to another page you have three options.</p>

<pre><code> window.location.href='otherpage.com';
 window.location.assign('otherpage.com');
 //and...

 window.location.replace('otherpage.com');
</code></pre>

<p>As you want to move to another page, you can use any from these if this is your requirement.
However all three options are limited to different situations. Chose wisely according to your requirement.</p>

<p>If you are interested in more knowledge about the concept, you can go through further.</p>

<pre><code>window.location.href; returns the href (URL) of the current page
window.location.hostname; returns the domain name of the web host
window.location.pathname; returns the path and filename of the current page
window.location.protocol; returns the web protocol used (http: or https:)
window.location.assign; loads a new document
</code></pre>

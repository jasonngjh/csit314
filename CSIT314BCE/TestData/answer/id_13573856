<p><code>git fetch</code> will retrieve remote branches so that you can <code>git diff</code> or <code>git merge</code> them with the current branch. <code>git pull</code> will run fetch on the remote brach tracked by the current branch and then merge the result. You can use <code>git fetch</code> to see if there are any updates to the remote branch without necessary merging them with your local branch.</p>

<p>The best option for me and probably others is the Git reset option:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard &lt;commidId&gt; &amp;&amp; git clean -f
</code></pre>

<p>This has been the best option for me! It is simple, fast and effective!</p>

  <p>** Note:** As mentioned in comments don't do this if you're sharing your branch with other people who have copies of the old commits</p>

<p>Also from the comments, if you wanted a less 'ballzy' method you could use </p>

<pre><code>git clean -i
</code></pre>

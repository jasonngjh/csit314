<p>If you have complex objects in the array you can use filters? 
In situations where $.inArray or array.splice is not as easy to use. Especially if the objects are perhaps shallow in the array.</p>

<p>E.g. if you have an object with an Id field and you want the object removed from an array:</p>

<pre><code>this.array = this.array.filter(function(element, i) {
    return element.id !== idToRemove;
});
</code></pre>

<p>For </p>

<pre><code>var myObject = {
    "ircEvent": "PRIVMSG",
    "method": "newURI",
    "regex": "^http://.*"
};
</code></pre>

<p>delete myObject["regex"];
Also you know index of key , for Eg. You need to delete 2nd key(regex)
then </p>

<pre><code>var key =  Object.keys(myObject)[2]
delete myObject[key];
</code></pre>

<p>Many time we require index based removing in object But Remember keys in object may be up-down position so please careful during using it</p>

<p>Not technically. But you can workaround as follows.</p>

<pre><code>{
  "json": "actual data goes here, comments below",
  "comment1": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
  "comment2": "consectetur adipiscing elit"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just put the comments in the data. If you number them to make each key path unique, you should have no problems.</p>

<p><code>yield</code> is like a return element for a function. The difference is, that the <code>yield</code> element turns a function into a generator. A generator behaves just like a function until something is 'yielded'. The generator stops until it is next called, and continues from exactly the same point as it started. You can get a sequence of all the 'yielded' values in one, by calling <code>list(generator())</code>.</p>

<p><strong><em>This won't work if you have a tag with the same name as the branch on the remote:</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin :branch-or-tag-name
error: dst refspec branch-or-tag-name matches more than one.
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:SomeName/some-repo.git'
</code></pre>

<p>In that case you need to specify that you want to delete the branch, not the tag:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin :refs/heads/branch-or-tag-name
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, to delete the tag instead of the branch you would use:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin :refs/tags/branch-or-tag-name
</code></pre>

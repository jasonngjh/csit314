<p>you can use the <code>delete</code> operator as of below.</p>

<pre><code> var multiverse = {
        earth1: "Silver Age",
        earth2: "Golden Age"
    };

delete multiverse.earth2;//will return true if it finds 

// Outputs: { earth1: "Silver Age" }
console.log(multiverse);
</code></pre>

<p>The delete operator also has a <code>return value.</code> If it succeeds in deleting a property, it will return true. If it fails to delete a property because the property is unwritable it will <code>return false</code>, or if in strict mode it will throw an error.</p>

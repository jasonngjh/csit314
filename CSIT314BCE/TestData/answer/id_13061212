<p>I prefer to use <code>git rebase -i</code> for this job, because a nice list pops up where I can choose the commits to get rid of. It might not be as direct as some other answers here, but it just <em>feels right</em>.</p>

<p>Choose how many commits you want to list, then invoke like this (to enlist last three)</p>

<pre><code>git rebase -i HEAD~3
</code></pre>

<p>Sample list</p>

<pre><code>pick aa28ba7 Sanity check for RtmpSrv port
pick c26c541 RtmpSrv version option
pick 58d6909 Better URL decoding support
</code></pre>

<p>Then Git will remove commits for any line that you remove.</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1053633">Git Bash</a> you can execute the following:</p>

<pre><code>git branch --delete &lt;branch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>From the GitHub desktop application, when you have the branch checked out, you can delete the <strong>local</strong> branch via the <em>Branch</em> menu strip:</p>

<p>If you <strong><em>are not</em></strong> using the GitHub desktop application and are using an IDE like Visual Studio for your local source control, all you have to do is a couple of quick steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check out a branch other than the one you wish to delete.</li>
<li>Right-click the branch you wish to delete.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Delete</strong> option from the context menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, once logged in to your GitHub account online, go to the repository and click the <strong><em>All Branches</em></strong> tab.  From there, just click the little trash can icon on the right on the name of the branch you wish to delete.</p>

<p>*Keep in mind - if the branch isn't published, there isn't any need to try to delete it from your online repository.</p>

<p>I solved this by completing the setup of 'MAIL FROM' in AWS SES. This set the mail from header in emails to be my domain name.</p>

<p>"HEADER_FROM_DIFFERENT_DOMAINS" and mail-tester.com now gives me a score of 10/10.</p>

<p>Note that for some email providers it took a few weeks before we were trusted and emails stopped going to spam.</p>

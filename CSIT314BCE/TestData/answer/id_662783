<p>You can do some interesting things with the stack.  For instance, you have functions like <a href="http://everything2.com/title/alloca%2528%2529" rel="noreferrer">alloca</a> (assuming you can get past the copious warnings concerning its use), which is a form of malloc that specifically uses the stack, not the heap, for memory.</p>

<p>That said, stack-based memory errors are some of the worst I've experienced.  If you use heap memory, and you overstep the bounds of your allocated block, you have a decent chance of triggering a segment fault.  (Not 100%: your block may be incidentally contiguous with another that you have previously allocated.)  But since variables created on the stack are always contiguous with each other, writing out of bounds can change the value of another variable.  I have learned that whenever I feel that my program has stopped obeying the laws of logic, it is probably buffer overflow.</p>

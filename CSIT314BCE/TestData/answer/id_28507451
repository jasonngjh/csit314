<p><strong>I do not understand why the answers are so complex here.</strong></p>

<p>Here is a closure:</p>

<pre><code>var a = 42;

function b() { return a; }
</code></pre>

<p>Yes. You probably use that many times a day.</p>

  <p>There is no reason to believe closures are a complex design hack to address specific problems. No, closures are just about using a variable that comes from a higher scope <strong>from the perspective of where the function was declared (not run)</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Now what it <em>allows</em> you to do can be more spectacular, see other answers.</p>

<p>In order to get rid of (all the changes in) last commit, last 2 commits and last n commits:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~2
...
git reset --hard HEAD~n
</code></pre>

<p>And, to get rid of anything after a specific commit:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard &lt;commit sha&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>e.g., </p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard 0d12345
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>PS:<br>
  1- Be careful, because of "hard" option, it deletes the local changes
  in your repo as well and reverts to the previous mentioned commit. You
  should run this if you are sure you messed up in your last commit(s)
  and would like to go back in time. </p>
  
  <p>2- Usually 7 letters of "commit sha" is enough, but in bigger
  projects, you may need up to 12 letters to guarantee be unique. You
  also can mention the whole 40 letters sha.</p>
  
  <p>3- The above commands work in Github for Windows as well.</p>

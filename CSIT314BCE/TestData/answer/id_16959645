<p>OK, 6-year-old closures fan. Do you want to hear the simplest example of closure?</p>

<p>Let's imagine the next situation: a driver is sitting in a car. That car is inside a plane. Plane is in the airport. The ability of driver to access things outside his car, but inside the plane, even if that plane leaves an airport, is a closure. That's it. When you turn 27, look at the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/111200/1393791">more detailed explanation</a> or at the example below.</p>

<p>Here is how I can convert my plane story into the code.</p>

<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var plane = function(defaultAirport) {

  var lastAirportLeft = defaultAirport;

  var car = {
    driver: {
      startAccessPlaneInfo: function() {
        setInterval(function() {
          console.log("Last airport was " + lastAirportLeft);
        }, 2000);
      }
    }
  };
  car.driver.startAccessPlaneInfo();

  return {
    leaveTheAirport: function(airPortName) {
      lastAirportLeft = airPortName;
    }
  }
}("Boryspil International Airport");

plane.leaveTheAirport("John F. Kennedy");</code></pre>

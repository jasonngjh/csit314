<p><strong>Yield is an object</strong></p>

<p>A <code>return</code> in a function will return a single value.</p>

<p>If you want <strong>a function to return a huge set of values</strong>, use <code>yield</code>.</p>

<p>More importantly, <code>yield</code> is a <strong>barrier</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>like barrier in the CUDA language, it will not transfer control until it gets
  completed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, it will run the code in your function from the beginning until it hits <code>yield</code>. Then, itâ€™ll return the first value of the loop.</p>

<p>Then, every other call will run the loop you have written in the function one more time, returning the next value until there isn't any value to return.</p>

<p>Weighing in with yet another possibility.</p>

<p>If you want readability your original one-liner was pretty good, but I would change the ranges to be the same as I think the negative bounds make things less clear.</p>

<pre><code>[x for x in range(6, 10)] + [-x for x in range(6, 10)]
</code></pre>

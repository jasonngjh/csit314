<p>There are many answers that provide removing the last commit. However, here is asked how to remove specific commits, and in this case it is to remove the last three commits, to go back to commit on November 3.</p>

<p>You can do this with rebase. Simply do:</p>

<pre><code>git rebase -i HEAD~4
</code></pre>

<p>This will list your last four commits.</p>

<p>Now you have the option to remove commits. You do that with <code>drop</code> text.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Simply hit <code>i</code> on your keyboard and next to commits you want to remove write <code>drop</code> instead of default <code>pick</code></p></li>
<li><p>On the keyboard, hit <code>exit</code> and <code>:wq</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>To make sure that commits are removed, write:</p>

<pre><code>git log
</code></pre>

<p>You will see that commits you saved as drop are removed.</p>

<p>To push those changes to your remote branch, write:</p>

<pre><code>git push --force
</code></pre>

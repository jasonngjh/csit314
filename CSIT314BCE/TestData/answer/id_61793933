<p>You should probably do a radical re-design where you create a struct <code>runway</code>, containing a queue for landing, one for take-off and all the needed variables. Essentially what the airport struct is currently doing. Maybe something along the lines of this:</p>

<pre><code>struct runway
{
    struct queue landing;
    struct queue takeoff;
    ... // whatever other variables the individual runway needs

};

struct airport
{
  struct runway runways[3];
  ... // variables not related to runways but the whole airport
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can also add functionality per runway, to give it a certain behavior. For example there might be a "landing only" runway, which is a certain kind of runway. Before you know it, you might be implementing a simplistic version of the OO concept inheritance.</p>

<p>This is a verbose regex, designed to operate on a single line, so make sure to use the <code>re.VERBOSE</code> flag and feed it one line at a time. It'll capture the first unquoted hash as group 1 if there is one, so you can use <code>match.start(1)</code> to get the index. It doesn't handle backslash escapes, if you want to be able to put a backslash-escaped quote in a string. This is untested.</p>

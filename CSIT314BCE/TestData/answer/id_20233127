<p>Many of the other answers will lead to errors/warnings. This approach is relatively fool proof although you may still need <code>git branch -D branch_to_delete</code> if it's not fully merged into <code>some_other_branch</code>, for example.</p>

<pre><code>git checkout some_other_branch
git push origin :branch_to_delete
git branch -d branch_to_delete
</code></pre>

<p>Remote pruning isn't needed if you deleted the remote branch. It's only used to get the most up-to-date remotes available on a repository you're tracking. I've observed <code>git fetch</code> will add remotes, not remove them. Here's an example of when <code>git remote prune origin</code> will actually do something:</p>

<p>User A does the steps above. User B would run the following commands to see the most up-to-date remote branches:</p>

<pre><code>git fetch
git remote prune origin
git branch -r
</code></pre>

<p>JSON does not support comments natively, but you can make your own decoder or at least preprocessor to strip out comments, that's perfectly fine (as long as you just ignore comments and don't use them to guide how your application should process the JSON data).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JSON does not have comments. A JSON encoder MUST NOT output comments.
  A JSON decoder MAY accept and ignore comments.</p>
  
  <p>Comments should never be used to transmit anything meaningful. That is
  what JSON is for.</p>

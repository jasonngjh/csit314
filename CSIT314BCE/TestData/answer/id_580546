<p><code>string</code> is a reserved word, but <code>String</code> is just a class name. 
This means that <code>string</code> cannot be used as a variable name by itself.</p>

<p>If for some reason you wanted a variable called <em>string</em>, you'd see only the first of these compiles:</p>

<pre><code>StringBuilder String = new StringBuilder();  // compiles
StringBuilder string = new StringBuilder();  // doesn't compile 
</code></pre>

<p>If you really want a variable name called <em>string</em> you can use <code>@</code> as a prefix:</p>

<pre><code>StringBuilder @string = new StringBuilder();
</code></pre>

<p>Another critical difference: Stack Overflow highlights them differently. </p>

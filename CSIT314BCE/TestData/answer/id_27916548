<p>If you have not pushed the code to your remote branch (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitbucket">Bitbucket</a>) you can change the commit message on the command line as below.</p>

<pre><code> git commit --amend -m "Your new message"
</code></pre>

<p>If you're working on a specific branch do this:</p>

<pre><code>git commit --amend -m "BRANCH-NAME: new message"
</code></pre>

<p>If you've already pushed the code with the wrong message, and you need to be careful when changing the message. That is, after you change the commit message and try pushing it again, you end up with having issues. To make it smooth, follow these steps.</p>

<p><strong>Please read my entire answer before doing it.</strong></p>

<pre><code>git commit --amend -m "BRANCH-NAME : your new message"

git push -f origin BRANCH-NAME                # Not a best practice. Read below why?
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Important note:</strong> When you use the force push directly you might end up with code issues that other developers are working on the same branch. So to avoid those conflicts, you need to pull the code from your branch before making the <strong>force push</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> git commit --amend -m "BRANCH-NAME : your new message"
 git pull origin BRANCH-NAME
 git push -f origin BRANCH-NAME
</code></pre>

<p>This is the best practice when changing the commit message, if it was already pushed.</p>

<p>It means that the envelope sender address (which is used at the SMTP level) is different to the address used in the From header. This is very common, but can be a problem if you try to implement DMARC alignment. For example, you might send a message with a from header containing <code>user@example.com</code>, but your envelope sender might be <code>bouncehandler@mail.example.com</code>. You should be able to see this in the Return path header of a received message. Whether you can change this depends on exactly how you're sending your message, but in PHPMailer the envelope sender defaults to the from address, and you can override it by setting the <code>Sender</code> property.</p>

<p>A -0.1 penalty is unlikely to be the entire cause of your mail being sent to spam.</p>

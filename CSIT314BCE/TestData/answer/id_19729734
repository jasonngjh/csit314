<p>There's a quote on this issue from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14975275-illustrated-c-2012" rel="noreferrer">Daniel Solis' book</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All the predefined types  are mapped directly to
  underlying .NET types. The C# type names (string) are simply aliases for the
  .NET types (String or System.String), so using the .NET names works fine syntactically, although
  this is discouraged. Within a C# program, you should use the C# names
  rather than the .NET names.</p>

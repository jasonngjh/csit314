<p><strong>OK,</strong> deleting <strong>unwanted untracked files and folders</strong> are easy using <code>git</code> in command line, just do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>git clean -fd
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Double check</strong> before doing it as it will delete the files and folders without making any history...</p>

<p>Also in this case, <code>-f</code> stands for force and <code>-d</code> stands for directory...</p>

<p>So, if you want to delete files only, you can use <code>-f</code> only:</p>

<pre><code>git clean -f
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to <strong>delete</strong>(directories) and files, you can delete only untracked directories and files like this:</p>

<pre><code>git clean -fd
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you can use <code>-x</code> flag for including the files which are ignored by git. This would be helpful if you want to delete everything.</p>

<p>And adding <code>-i</code> flag, makes git asking you for permission for deleting files one by one on the go.</p>

<p>If you not sure and want to check things first, add <code>-n</code> flag.</p>

<p>Use <code>-q</code> if you don't want to see any report after successful deletion.</p>

<p>I also create the image below to make it more memorable, especially I have seen many people confuse <code>-f</code> for cleaning folder sometimes or mix it up somehow!</p>

<p>Sure you can comment JSON.  To read a commented JSON file from javascript you can strip comments before parsing it (see the code below).  I'm sure this code can be improved, but it is easy to understand for those who use regexp.</p>

<p>I use commented JSON files to specify neuron shapes for my synthetic reflex systems.  I also use commented JSON to store intermediate states for a running neuron system.  It is very convenient to have comments.  Don't listen to didacts who tell you they are a bad idea.</p>

<pre><code>fetch(filename).then(function(response) {
    return response.text();
}).then(function(commented) {
    return commented.
        replace(/\/\*[\s\S]*?\*\/|([^\\:]|^)\/\/.*$/gm, '$1').
        replace(/\r/,"\n").
        replace(/\n[\n]+/,"\n");
}).then(function(clean) {
    return JSON.parse(clean);
}).then(function(json) {
    // Do what you want with the JSON object.
});
</code></pre>

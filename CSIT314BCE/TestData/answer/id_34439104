<h3>Bonus:</h3>

<p>In speaking of pull/fetch/merge in the previous answers, I would like to share an interesting and productive trick,</p>

<h1><strong><code>git pull --rebase</code></strong></h1>

<p>This above command is the most useful command in my Git life which saved a lot of time.</p>

<p>Before pushing your newly commit to server, try this command and it will automatically synchronise the latest server changes (with a fetch + merge) and will place your commit at the top in the Git log. There isn't any need to worry about manual pull/merge.</p>

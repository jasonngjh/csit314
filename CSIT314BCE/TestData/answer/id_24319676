<p>As far as I know, <code>string</code> is just an alias for <code>System.String</code>, and similar aliases exist for <code>bool</code>, <code>object</code>, <code>int</code>... the only subtle difference is that you can use <code>string</code> without a "using <code>System;</code>" directive, while String requires it (otherwise you should specify <code>System.String</code> in full).</p>

<p>About which is the best to use, I guess it's a matter of taste. Personally I prefer <code>string</code>, but I it's not a religious issue.</p>

<p>No, you are not just targeting a CPU.  You are also targeting the OS.  Let's say you need to print something to the terminal screen using <code>cout</code>.  <code>cout</code> will eventually wind up calling an API function for the OS the program is running on.  That call can, and will, be different for different operating systems, so that means you need to compile the program for each OS so it makes the correct OS calls.</p>

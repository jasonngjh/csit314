<h2>How to fix the previous local commit</h2>

<p>Use git-gui (or similar) to perform a <code>git commit --amend</code>. From the GUI you can add or remove individual files from the commit. You can also modify the commit message. </p>

<h2>How to undo the previous local commit</h2>

<p>Just reset your branch to the previous location (for example, using <code>gitk</code> or <code>git rebase</code>). Then reapply your changes from a saved copy. After garbage collection in your local repository, it will be like the unwanted commit never happened. To do all of that in a single command, use <code>git reset HEAD~1</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Word of warning</strong>: <em>Careless use of <code>git reset</code> is a good way to get your working copy into a confusing state. I recommend that Git novices avoid this if they can.</em></p>

<h2>How to undo a public commit</h2>

<p>Perform a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1624724/86967">reverse cherry pick</a> (<a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert.html" rel="noreferrer">git-revert</a>) to undo the changes.</p>

<p>If you haven't yet pulled other changes onto your branch, you can simply do...</p>

<pre><code>git revert --no-edit HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>Then push your updated branch to the shared repository.</p>

<p><em>The commit history will show both commits, separately</em>.</p>

<h2>Advanced: Correction of the <em>private</em> branch in public repository</h2>

<h3><em>This can be dangerous -- be sure you have a local copy of the branch to repush.</em></h3>

<p><em>Also note: You don't want to do this if someone else may be working on the branch.</em></p>

<pre><code>git push --delete (branch_name) ## remove public version of branch
</code></pre>

<p>Clean up your branch locally then repush...</p>

<pre><code>git push origin (branch_name)
</code></pre>

<p><em>In the normal case, you probably needn't worry about your private-branch commit history being pristine.  Just push a followup commit (see 'How to undo a public commit' above), and later, do a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/22417539/86967">squash-merge</a> to hide the history.</em></p>

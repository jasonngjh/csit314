<p><code>2147483647 + 1</code> is executed as the sum of two <code>ints</code> and therefore overflows.</p>

<p><code>2147483648</code> is too big to fit in an <code>int</code> and is therefore assumed by the compiler to be a <code>long</code>.  It therefore does not overflow.</p>

<p>To perform the summation as a <code>long long</code> use the appropriate constant suffix, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>a = 2147483647LL + 1;
</code></pre>

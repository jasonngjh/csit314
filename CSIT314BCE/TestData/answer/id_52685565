<p>This answer is for Java programmers learning Python.
Every Java file typically contains one public class. You can use that class in two ways: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Call the class from other files. You just have to import it in the calling program.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the class stand alone, for testing purposes. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>For the latter case, the class should contain a public static void main() method. In Python this purpose is served by the globally defined label <code>'__main__'</code>.</p>

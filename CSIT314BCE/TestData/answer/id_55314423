<p>An analogy could help to grasp the idea here:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AJZlN.png" width="300" /></p>

<p>Imagine that you have created an amazing machine that is capable of generating thousands and thousands of lightbulbs per day. The machine generates these lightbulbs in boxes with a unique serial number. You don't have enough space to store all these lightbulbs at the same time (i.e., you cannot keep up with the speed of the machine due to storage limitation), so you would like to adjust this machine to generate lightbulbs on demand.</p>

<p>Python generators don't differ much from this concept.</p>

<p>Imagine that you have a function <code>x</code> that generates unique serial numbers for the boxes. Obviously, you can have a very large number of such barcodes generated by the function. A wiser, and space efficient, option is to generate those serial numbers on-demand.</p>

<p>Machine's code:</p>

<pre><code>def barcode_generator():
    serial_number = 10000  # Initial barcode
    while True:
        yield serial_number
        serial_number += 1


barcode = barcode_generator()
while True:
    number_of_lightbulbs_to_generate = int(input("How many lightbulbs to generate? "))
    barcodes = [next(barcode) for _ in range(number_of_lightbulbs_to_generate)]
    print(barcodes)

    # function_to_create_the_next_batch_of_lightbulbs(barcodes)

    produce_more = input("Produce more? [Y/n]: ")
    if produce_more == "n":
        break
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see we have a self-contained "function" to generate the next unique serial number each time. This function returns back a generator! As you can see we are not calling the function each time we need a new serial number, but we are using <code>next()</code> given the generator to obtain the next serial number.</p>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>How many lightbulbs to generate? 5
[10000, 10001, 10002, 10003, 10004]
Produce more? [Y/n]: y
How many lightbulbs to generate? 6
[10005, 10006, 10007, 10008, 10009, 10010]
Produce more? [Y/n]: y
How many lightbulbs to generate? 7
[10011, 10012, 10013, 10014, 10015, 10016, 10017]
Produce more? [Y/n]: n
</code></pre>

<p>This code was so ugly, I had to post it.</p>

<pre><code>def remove_comments(text):
    char_list = list(text)
    in_str = False
    deleting = False
    for i, c in enumerate(char_list):
        if deleting:
            if c == '\n':
                deleting = False
            else:
                char_list[i] = None
        elif c == '"':
            in_str = not in_str
        elif c == '#':
            if not in_str:
                deleting = True
                char_list[i] = None
    char_list = filter(lambda x: x is not None, char_list)
    return ''.join(char_list)
</code></pre>

<p>Seems to work though. Although I'm not sure how it might handle newline chars between windows and linux.</p>

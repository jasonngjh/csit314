<p>If you are planning to undo a local commit entirely, whatever you change you did on the commit, and if you don't worry anything about that, just do the following command.</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD^1
</code></pre>

<p>(This command will ignore your entire commit and your changes will be lost completely from your local working tree). If you want to undo your commit, but you want your changes in the staging area (before commit just like after <code>git add</code>) then do the following command.</p>

<pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD^1
</code></pre>

<p>Now your committed files come into the staging area. Suppose if you want to upstage the files, because you need to edit some wrong content, then do the following command</p>

<pre><code>git reset HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>Now committed files to come from the staged area into the unstaged area. Now files are ready to edit, so whatever you change, you want to go edit and added it and make a fresh/new commit.</p>

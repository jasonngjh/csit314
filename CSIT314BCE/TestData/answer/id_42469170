<p>Basically <strong>jQuery</strong> is just a <strong>JavaScript</strong> framework and for doing some of the things like <strong>redirection</strong> in this case, you can just use pure JavaScript, so in that case you have 3 options using vanilla JavaScript:</p>

<p>1) Using location <strong>replace</strong>, this will replace the current history of the page, means that it is not possible to use the <strong>back</strong> button to go back to the original page.</p>

<pre><code>window.location.replace("http://stackoverflow.com");
</code></pre>

<p>2) Using location <strong>assign</strong>, this will keep the history for you and with using back button, you can go back to the original page:</p>

<pre><code>window.location.assign("http://stackoverflow.com");
</code></pre>

<p>3) I recommend using one of those previous ways, but this could be the third option using pure JavaScript: </p>

<pre><code>window.location.href="http://stackoverflow.com";
</code></pre>

<p>You can also write a function in jQuery to handle it, but not recommended as it's only one line pure JavaScript function, also you can use all of above functions without window if you are already in the window scope, for example <code>window.location.replace("http://stackoverflow.com");</code> could be <code>location.replace("http://stackoverflow.com");</code></p>

<p>Also I show them all on the image below:</p>

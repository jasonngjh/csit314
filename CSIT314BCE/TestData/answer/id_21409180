<p>There is a good solution (hack), which is valid JSON, BUT IT WILL NOT WORK IN ALL CASES (see comments bellow). 
Just make the same key twice (or more). For example: </p>

<pre><code>{
  "param" : "This is the comment place",
  "param" : "This is value place",
}
</code></pre>

<p>So JSON will understand this as:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "param" : "This is value place",
}
</code></pre>

<p>There's one extra thing to mention: a function that yields doesn't actually have to terminate. I've written code like this:</p>

<pre><code>def fib():
    last, cur = 0, 1
    while True: 
        yield cur
        last, cur = cur, last + cur
</code></pre>

<p>Then I can use it in other code like this:</p>

<pre><code>for f in fib():
    if some_condition: break
    coolfuncs(f);
</code></pre>

<p>It really helps simplify some problems, and makes some things easier to work with. </p>

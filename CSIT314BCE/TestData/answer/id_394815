<p>From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions" rel="noreferrer" title="Conditional expressions">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conditional expressions (sometimes called a “ternary operator”) have the lowest priority of all Python operations.</p>
  
  <p>The expression <code>x if C else y</code> first evaluates the condition, <em>C</em> (<em>not x</em>); if <em>C</em> is true, <em>x</em> is evaluated and its value is returned; otherwise, <em>y</em> is evaluated and its value is returned.</p>
  
  <p>See <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/" rel="noreferrer" title="PEP 308 -- Conditional Expressions">PEP 308</a> for more details about conditional expressions.</p>

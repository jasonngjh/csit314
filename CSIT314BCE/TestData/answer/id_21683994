<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29">C</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++">C++</a> obey the "maximum munch" rule. The same way a---b is translated to <code>(a--) - b</code>, in your case  <code>x--&gt;0</code> translates to <code>(x--)&gt;0</code>.</p>

<p>What the rule says essentially is that going left to right, expressions are formed by taking the maximum of characters which will form an valid expression. </p>

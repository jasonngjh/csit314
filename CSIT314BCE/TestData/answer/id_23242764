<p><strong>How to undo the last Git commit?</strong></p>

<p>To restore everything back to the way it was prior to the last commit, we need to reset to the commit before HEAD.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you don't want to keep your changes that you made:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD^
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you want to keep your changes:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD^
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Now check your git log. It will show that our last commit has been removed.</p>

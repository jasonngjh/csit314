<p><strong><em>Sidenote:</em></strong> With modern Git (>= <a href="https://raw.github.com/git/git/master/Documentation/RelNotes/1.6.6.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">1.6.6</a>), you are able to use just</p>

<pre><code>git checkout test
</code></pre>

<p>(note that it is 'test' not 'origin/test') to perform magical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Do What I Mean">DWIM</a>-mery and create local branch 'test' for you, for which upstream would be remote-tracking branch 'origin/test'.</p>

<hr>

<p>The <code>* (no branch)</code> in <code>git branch</code> output means that you are on unnamed branch, in so called "detached HEAD" state (HEAD points directly to commit, and is not symbolic reference to some local branch).  If you made some commits on this unnamed branch, you can always create local branch off current commit:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout -b test HEAD
</code></pre>

<p><em>I found a comment buried below which seems to modernize this answer:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@Dennis: git checkout , for example git checkout
  origin/test results in detached HEAD / unnamed branch, while git
  checkout test or git checkout -b test origin/test results in local
  branch test (with remote-tracking branch origin/test as upstream) –

<p>emphasis on <code>git checkout origin/test</code></p>

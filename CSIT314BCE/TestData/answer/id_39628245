<p><strong>Git version 2.9.2</strong></p>

<p>If you want to change the name of the local branch you are on:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -m new_name
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to change the name of a different branch:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -m old_name new_name
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to change the name of a different branch to a name that already exists:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -M old_name new_name_that_already_exists
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note: The last command is destructive and will rename your branch, but you will lose the old branch with that name and those commits because branch names must be unique.</strong></p>

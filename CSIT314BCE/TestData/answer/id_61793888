<p>If you don't want to deal with Qt resource system, you might convert your images to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap" rel="nofollow noreferrer">XPM format</a>, which is a textual representation of an image, and <strong>embed</strong> it into your source code. There are plenty of online converters you can use.</p>

<p>For example, you can store the converted image as a <code>static char *</code> array in the source code and use it in the GUI, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>/* An image in XPM */
static char *imageTxt[] = {
    /* columns rows colors chars-per-pixel */
    "300 292 64 1 ",
    "  c black",
    etc.
[..]

QLabel l;
l.setPixmap( QPixmap(imageTxt) );
l.show();
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, this is what Qt's resource system does automatically.</p>

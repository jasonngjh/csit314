<p>In my case I committed and pushed to the wrong branch, so what I wanted was to have all my changes back so I can commit them to a new correct branch, so I did this:</p>

<p>On the same branch that you committed and pushed, if you type "git status" you won't see anything new because you committed and pushed, now type:</p>

<p><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1</code></p>

<p>This will get all your changes(files) back in the stage area, now to get them back in the working directory(unstage) you just type:</p>

<pre><code>git reset FILE
</code></pre>

<p>Where "File" is the file that you want to commit again. Now, this FILE should be in the working directory(unstaged) with all the changes that you did. Now you can change to whatever branch that you want and commit the changes in that branch. Hope this helps other people that made the same mistake I did. Of course, the initial branch that you committed is still there with all changes, but in my case that was ok, if it is not for you-you can look for ways to revert that commit in that branch.</p>

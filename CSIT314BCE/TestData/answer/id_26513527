<p>Despite the original question, the top answers can cause problems for people who have a similar problem, but don't want to lose their local files. For example, see Al-Punk and crizCraig's comments. </p>

<p>The following version commits your local changes to a temporary branch (<code>tmp</code>), checks out the original branch (which I'm assuming is <code>master</code>) and merges the updates. You could do this with <code>stash</code>, but I've found it's usually easier to simply use the branch / merge approach.</p>

<pre><code>git checkout -b tmp
git add *; git commit -am "my temporary files"
git checkout master

git fetch origin master
git merge -s recursive -X theirs origin master
</code></pre>

<p>where we assume the <strong>other repository</strong> is <code>origin master</code>.</p>

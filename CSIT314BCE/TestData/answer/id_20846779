<p>I am surprised nobody mentioned this before:</p>

<pre><code>git clean -i
</code></pre>

<p>That stands for <em>interactive</em> and you will get a quick overview of what is going to be deleted offering you the possibility to include/exclude the affected files. Overall, still faster than running the mandatory <code>--dry-run</code> before the real cleaning.</p>

<p>You will have to toss in a <code>-d</code> if you also want to take care of empty folders. At the end, it makes  for a nice alias:</p>

<pre><code>git iclean
</code></pre>

<p>That being said, the extra hand holding of interactive commands can be tiring for experienced users.  These days I just use the already mentioned <code>git clean -fd</code> </p>

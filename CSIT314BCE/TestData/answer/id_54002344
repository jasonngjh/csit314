<p>Another difference between both function is functionOne can be used as a variable that can hold multiple functions within and functionTwo holds some block of code that gets executed all when called. Please check below :</p>

<pre><code>   var functionOne = (function() {
      return {

         sayHello: function(){
                console.log('say hello')

         },
         redirectPage:function(_url){
                window.location.href = _url;
         }

      }
})();
</code></pre>

<p>You have a choice which function to be called. e.g functionOne.sayHello or functionOne. redirectPage. And if you call functionTwo then whole block of code will get executed.</p>

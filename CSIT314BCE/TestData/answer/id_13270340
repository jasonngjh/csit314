<p>Tip: When you delete branches using</p>

<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git branch -d &lt;branchname&gt; # Deletes local branch
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git push origin :&lt;branchname&gt; # Deletes remote branch
</code></pre>

<p>only the references are deleted. Even though the branch is actually removed on the remote, the references to it still exists in the local repositories of your team members. This means that for other team members the deleted branches are still visible when they do a <code>git branch -a</code>.</p>

<p>To solve this, your team members can prune the deleted branches with</p>

<pre><code>git remote prune &lt;repository&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is typically <code>git remote prune origin</code>.</p>

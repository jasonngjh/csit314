<p>Closure are not difficult to understand. It depends only from the point of view.</p>

<p>I personally like to use them in cases of daily life.</p>

<pre><code>function createCar()
{
    var rawMaterial = [/* lots of object */];
    function transformation(rawMaterials)
    {
       /* lots of changement here */
       return transformedMaterial;
    }
    var transformedMaterial = transformation(rawMaterial);
    function assemblage(transformedMaterial)
    {
        /*Assemblage of parts*/
        return car;
    }
    return assemblage(transformedMaterial);
}
</code></pre>

<p>We only need to go through certain steps in particular cases. As for the transformation of materials is only useful when you have the parts.</p>

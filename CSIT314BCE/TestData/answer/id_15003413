<p>We simply say:</p>

<pre><code>git pull == git fetch + git merge
</code></pre>

<p>If you run <code>git pull</code>, you do not need to merge the data to local. If you run <code>git fetch</code>, it means you must run <code>git merge</code> for getting the latest code to your local machine. Otherwise, the local machine code would not be changed without merge. </p>

<p>So in the Git Gui, when you do fetch, you have to merge the data. Fetch itself won't make the code changes at your local. You can check that when you update the code by fetching
once fetch and see; the code it won't change. Then you merge... You will see the changed code.</p>

<p>Rename the branch will be useful once your branch is finished. Then new stuff is coming, and you want to develop in the same branch instead of deleting it and create the new one.</p>

<p>From my experience, to rename a local and remote branch in Git you should do the following steps.</p>

<h3>1. Rename your local branch</h3>

<p>If you are on the branch you want to rename:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -m new-name
</code></pre>

<p>If you are on a different branch:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -m old-name new-name
</code></pre>

<h3>2. Delete the old-name remote branch and push the new-name local branch</h3>

<pre><code>git push origin :old-name new-name
</code></pre>

<h3>3. Reset the upstream branch for the new-name local branch</h3>

<pre><code>git push origin -u new-name
</code></pre>

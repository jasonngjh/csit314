<p>You can fetch from a remote repository, see the differences and then pull or merge.</p>

<p>This is an example for a remote repository called <code>origin</code> and a branch called <code>master</code> tracking the remote branch <code>origin/master</code>:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout master                                                  
git fetch                                        
git diff origin/master
git rebase origin master
</code></pre>

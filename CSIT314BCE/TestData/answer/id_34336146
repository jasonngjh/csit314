<h3>1. Rename</h3>

<p><strong>If it is your current branch, just do</strong></p>

<pre><code>git branch -m new_name
</code></pre>

<p><strong>If it is another branch you want to rename</strong></p>

<pre><code>git branch -m old_name new_name
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>2. Track a new remote branch</h3>

<p><strong>- If your branch was pushed, then after renaming you need to delete it from the remote Git repository and ask your new local to track a new remote branch:</strong></p>

<pre><code>git push origin :old_name
git push --set-upstream origin new_name
</code></pre>

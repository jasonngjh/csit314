  <em>NovoGeek.com - Krishna's weblog</em></p>

<p>It talks about browser support, but more importantly how to deal with it safely:</p>

<pre><code>function isStrictMode(){
    return !this;
} 
/*
   returns false, since 'this' refers to global object and 
   '!this' becomes false
*/

function isStrictMode(){   
    "use strict";
    return !this;
} 
/* 
   returns true, since in strict mode the keyword 'this'
   does not refer to global object, unlike traditional JS. 
   So here, 'this' is 'undefined' and '!this' becomes true.
*/
</code></pre>

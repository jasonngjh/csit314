<p>I'd simply point them to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Closures">Mozilla Closures page</a>. It's the best, most <strong>concise and simple explanation</strong> of closure basics and practical usage that I've found. It is highly recommended to anyone learning JavaScript.</p>

<p>And yes, I'd even recommend it to a 6-year old -- if the 6-year old is learning about closures, then it's logical they're ready to comprehend the <em>concise and simple explanation</em> provided in the article.</p>

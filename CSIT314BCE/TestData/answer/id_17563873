<p>Java has only pass by value. A very simple example to validate this.</p>

<pre><code>public void test() {
    MyClass obj = null;
    init(obj);
    //After calling init method, obj still points to null
    //this is because obj is passed as value and not as reference.
}
private void init(MyClass objVar) {
    objVar = new MyClass();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NO</strong>. JSON used to support comments, but they were abused and removed from the standard.</p>

<p>From the creator of JSON:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I removed comments from JSON because I saw people were using them to hold parsing directives, a practice which would have destroyed interoperability.  I know that the lack of comments makes some people sad, but it shouldn't.  - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506232618/https://plus.google.com/118095276221607585885/posts/RK8qyGVaGSr" rel="noreferrer">Douglas Crockford, 2012</a></p>

<p>The official JSON site is at <a href="http://json.org" rel="noreferrer">JSON.org</a>. JSON is defined as a <a href="http://ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-404.htm" rel="noreferrer">standard</a> by ECMA International. There is always a petition process to have standards revised. It is unlikely that annotations will be added to the JSON standard for several reasons.</p>

<p>JSON by design is an easily reverse-engineered (human parsed) alternative to XML. It is simplified even to the point that annotations are unnecessary. It is not even a markup language. The goal is stability and  interoperablilty.</p>

<p>Anyone who understands the "has-a" relationship of object orientation can understand any JSON structure - that is the whole point. It is just a  directed acyclic graph (DAG) with node tags (key/value pairs), which is a near universal data structure.</p>

<p>This only annotation required might be "//These are DAG tags". The key names can be as informative as required, allowing arbitrary semantic arity.</p>

<p>Any platform can parse JSON with just a few lines of code. XML requires complex OO libraries that are not viable on many platforms.</p>

<p>Annotations would just make JSON make less interoperable. There is simply nothing else to add, unless what you really need is a markup language (XML), and don't care if your persisted data is easily parsed.</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> as the creator of JSON also observed, there has always been JS pipeline support for comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go ahead and insert all the comments you like.
  Then pipe it through JSMin before handing it to your JSON parser. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506232618/https://plus.google.com/118095276221607585885/posts/RK8qyGVaGSr" rel="noreferrer">Douglas Crockford, 2012</a></p>

<h2>Use class toggling, not style editing . . .</h2>

<p>Using classes designated for "hiding" elements is easy and also one of the most efficient methods. Toggling a class 'hidden' with a <code>Display</code> style of 'none' will perform faster than editing that style directly. I explained some of this pretty thoroughly in Stack Overflow question <em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17725361/turning-two-elements-visible-hidden-in-same-div/17726550#answer-17726550">Turning two elements visible/hidden in the same div</a></em>.</p>

<p>A friend was having issues in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_8" rel="noreferrer">Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;8</a> and showed me what he did. I told him it was wrong, and he told me he got the answer here. The current top answer will not work in all browsers (Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;8 for example), and it will only remove the first occurrence of the item.</p>

<h2>Remove ALL instances from an array</h2>

<pre><code>function remove(arr, item) {
    for (var i = arr.length; i--;) {
        if (arr[i] === item) {
            arr.splice(i, 1);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It loops through the array backwards (since indices and length will change as items are removed) and removes the item if it's found. It works in all browsers.</p>

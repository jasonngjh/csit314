<p>I had this problem myself (in a situation where replacing the array was acceptable) and solved it with a simple:</p>

<pre><code>var filteredItems = this.items.filter(function (i) {
    return i !== item;
});
</code></pre>

<p>To give the above snippet a bit of context:</p>

<pre><code>self.thingWithItems = {
    items: [],
    removeItem: function (item) {
        var filteredItems = this.items.filter(function (i) {
            return i !== item;
        });

        this.items = filteredItems;
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This solution should work with both reference and value items. It all depends whether you need to maintain a reference to the original array as to whether this solution is applicable.</p>

<p>I foolishly named a branch starting with a hyphen, and then checked out master.  I didn't want to <strong>delete</strong> my branch, I had work in it.</p>

<p>Neither of these worked:</p>

<p><code>git checkout -dumb-name</code></p>

<p><code>git checkout -- -dumb-name</code></p>

<p><code>"</code>s, <code>'</code>s and <code>\</code>s didn't help either.  <code>git branch -m</code> doesn't work.</p>

<p>Here's how I finally fixed it. Go into your working copy's .git/refs/heads, find the filename "-dumb-name", get the hash of the branch.  Then this will check it out, make a new branch with a sane name, and delete the old one.</p>

<pre><code>git checkout {hash}
git checkout -b brilliant-name
git branch -d -- -dumb-name
</code></pre>

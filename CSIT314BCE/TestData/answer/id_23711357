<p>Closure is when a function is <strong>closed</strong> in a way that it was defined in a namespace which is immutable by the time the function is called.</p>

<p>In JavaScript, it happens when you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define one function inside the other function</li>
<li>The inner function is called after the outer function returned</li>
</ul>



<pre><code>// 'name' is resolved in the namespace created for one invocation of bindMessage
// the processor cannot enter this namespace by the time displayMessage is called
function bindMessage(name, div) {

    function displayMessage() {
        alert('This is ' + name);
    }

    $(div).click(displayMessage);
}
</code></pre>

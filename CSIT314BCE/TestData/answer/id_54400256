<p>The <strong>splice()</strong> method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.</p>

<p><strong>array.splice(start[, deleteCount[, item1[, item2[, ...]]]])</strong></p>

<p><strong>start</strong></p>

<p>The index at which to start changing the array (with origin 0). If greater than the length of the array, the actual starting index will be set to the length of the array. If negative, it will begin that many elements from the end of the array (with origin -1) and will be set to 0 if the absolute value is greater than the length of the array.</p>

<p><strong>deleteCount Optional</strong></p>

<p>An integer indicating the number of old array elements to remove.</p>

<p>If deleteCount is omitted, or if its value is larger than array.length - start (that is, if it is greater than the number of elements left in the array, starting at start), then all of the elements from start through the end of the array will be deleted.
If deleteCount is 0 or negative, no elements are removed. In this case, you should specify at least one new element (see below).</p>

<p><strong>item1, item2, ... Optional</strong></p>

<p>The elements to add to the array, beginning at the start index. If you don't specify any elements, splice() will only remove elements from the array.</p>

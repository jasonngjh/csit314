<p>While most of the previous answers answer the question, it is not clear enough why the <code>slice()</code> method has not been used. Yes, <code>filter()</code> meets the immutability criteria, but how about doing the following shorter equivalent?</p>

<pre><code>const myArray = [1,2,3,4];
</code></pre>

<p>And now letâ€™s say that we should remove the second element from the array, we can simply do:</p>

<pre><code>const newArray = myArray.slice(0, 1).concat(myArray.slice(2, 4));

// [1,3,4]
</code></pre>

<p>This way of deleting an element from an array is strongly encouraged today in the community due to its simple and immutable nature. In general, methods which cause mutation should be avoided. For example, you are encouraged to replace <code>push()</code> with <code>concat()</code> and <code>splice()</code> with <code>slice()</code>.</p>

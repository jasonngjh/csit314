<p>A simple test to check whether a language supports pass-by-reference is simply writing a traditional swap.
Can you write a traditional swap(a,b) method/function in Java?</p>

<p>A traditional swap method or function takes two arguments and swaps them such that variables passed into the function are changed outside the function. Its basic structure looks like</p>

<p>(Non-Java) Basic swap function structure</p>

<pre><code>swap(Type arg1, Type arg2) {
    Type temp = arg1;
    arg1 = arg2;
    arg2 = temp;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you can write such a method/function in your language such that calling</p>

<pre><code>Type var1 = ...;
Type var2 = ...;
swap(var1,var2);
</code></pre>

<p>actually switches the values of the variables var1 and var2, the language supports pass-by-reference.
But <strong>Java does not allow such a thing</strong> as it supports passing the values only and not pointers or references.</p>

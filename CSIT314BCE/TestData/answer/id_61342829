<p><strong>PYTHON MAIN FUNCTION</strong> is a starting point of any program. When the program is run, the python interpreter runs the code sequentially. Main function is executed only when it is run as a Python program ... </p>

<pre><code>def main():
     print ("i am in the function")
print ("i am out of function")
</code></pre>

<p>when you run script show : </p>

<pre><code>i am out of function
</code></pre>

<p>and not the code "i am in the function"
It is because we did not declare the call function "if__name__== "<strong>main</strong>".
if you use from it :</p>

<pre><code>def main():
     print ("i am in the function")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

print ("i am out of function")
</code></pre>

<p>The output is equal to</p>

<pre><code>i am in the function
i am out of function
</code></pre>

<p>In Python "if__name__== "<strong>main</strong>" allows you to run the Python files either as reusable modules or standalone programs.</p>

<p>When Python interpreter reads a source file, it will execute all the code found in it.
When Python runs the "source file" as the main program, it sets the special variable (<strong>name</strong>) to have a value ("<strong>main</strong>").</p>

<p>When you execute the main function, it will then read the "if" statement and checks whether <strong>name</strong> does equal to <strong>main</strong>.</p>

<p>In Python "if__name__== "<strong>main</strong>" allows you to run the Python files either as reusable modules or standalone programs.</p>

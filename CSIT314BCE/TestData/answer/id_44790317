<p>For sake of completeness, I will give the one glaringly obvious method that was overlooked by the previous answers.</p>

<p>Since the commit was not pushed, the remote was unchanged, so:</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete the local repository.</li>
<li>Clone the remote repository.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is sometimes necessary if your fancy Git client goes bye-bye. (eg. <code>non-fast-forward</code> errors)</p>

<p>Don't forget to re-commit your <em>saved</em> changes since the last push.</p>

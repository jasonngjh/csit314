<p><strong>OK</strong>, the answer is easy... You basically see the branch, but you don't have a local copy yet!...</p>

<p>You need to <code>fetch</code> the branch... </p>

<p>You can simply fetch and then checkout to the branch, use the one line command below to do that:</p>

<pre><code>git fetch &amp;&amp; git checkout test
</code></pre>

<p>I also created the image below for you to share the differences, look at how <code>fetch</code> works and also how it's different to <code>pull</code>:</p>

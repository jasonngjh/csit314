<p>There once was a caveman </p>

<pre><code>function caveman {
</code></pre>

<p>who had a very special rock,</p>

<pre><code>var rock = "diamond";
</code></pre>

<p>You could not get the rock yourself because it was in the caveman's private cave. Only the caveman knew how to find and get the rock.</p>

<pre><code>return {
    getRock: function() {
        return rock;
    }
};
}
</code></pre>

<p>Luckily, he was a friendly caveman, and if you were willing to wait for his return, he would gladly get it for you.</p>

<pre><code>var friend = caveman();
var rock = friend.getRock();
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty smart caveman.</p>

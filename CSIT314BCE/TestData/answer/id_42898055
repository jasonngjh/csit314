<p>As your commits are pushed remotely, you need to remove them. Let me assume your branch is <em>develop</em> and it is pushed over <em>origin</em>.</p>

<p>You first need to remove <em>develop</em> from <em>origin</em>:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin :develop (note the colon)
</code></pre>

<p>Then you need to get develop to the status you want, let me assume the commit hash is EFGHIJK:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard EFGHIJK
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, push <em>develop</em> again:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin develop
</code></pre>

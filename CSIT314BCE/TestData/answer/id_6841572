<p>You've encountered a <a href="http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/clockchange.html?n=237&amp;year=1927" rel="noreferrer">local time discontinuity</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When local standard time was about to reach Sunday, 1. January 1928,
  00:00:00 clocks were turned backward 0:05:52 hours to Saturday, 31.
  December 1927, 23:54:08 local standard time instead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not particularly strange and has happened pretty much everywhere at one time or another as timezones were switched or changed due to political or administrative actions.</p>

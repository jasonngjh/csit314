<p>Other commenters have already covered the semantic difference of the two variants above. I wanted to note a stylistic difference: Only the "assignment" variation can set a property of another object.</p>

<p>I often build JavaScript modules with a pattern like this:</p>

<pre><code>(function(){
    var exports = {};

    function privateUtil() {
            ...
    }

    exports.publicUtil = function() {
            ...
    };

    return exports;
})();
</code></pre>

<p>With this pattern, your public functions will all use assignment, while your private functions use declaration.</p>

<p>(Note also that assignment should require a semicolon after the statement, while declaration prohibits it.)</p>

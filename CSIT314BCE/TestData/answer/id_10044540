<p>I wanted to undo the latest five commits in our shared repository. I looked up the revision id that I wanted to rollback to. Then I typed in the following.</p>

<pre><code>prompt&gt; git reset --hard 5a7404742c85
HEAD is now at 5a74047 Added one more page to catalogue
prompt&gt; git push origin master --force
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: bb/acl: neoneye is allowed. accepted payload.
To git@bitbucket.org:thecompany/prometheus.git
 + 09a6480...5a74047 master -&gt; master (forced update)
prompt&gt;
</code></pre>

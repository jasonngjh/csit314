<p><strong>OK</strong>, here are some information about <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code>, so you can understand the actual differences... in few simple words, <strong>fetch</strong> gets the latest data, but not the code changes and not going to mess with your current  local branch code, but <strong>pull</strong> get the code changes and merge it your local branch, read on to get more details about each:</p>

<h2>git fetch</h2>

<p>It will download all <strong>refs</strong> and <strong>objects</strong> and any new branches to your local Repository...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fetch branches and/or tags (collectively, "refs") from one or more
  other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their
  histories. Remote-tracking branches are updated (see the description
  of  below for ways to control this behavior).</p>
  
  <p>By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched is
  also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that
  you are interested in. This default behavior can be changed by using
  the --tags or --no-tags options or by configuring
  remote..tagOpt. By using a refspec that fetches tags explicitly,
  you can fetch tags that do not point into branches you are interested
  in as well.</p>
  
  <p>git fetch can fetch from either a single named repository or URL, or
  from several repositories at once if  is given and there is a
  remotes. entry in the configuration file. (See git-config<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nWYnQ.png" rel="noreferrer">1</a>).</p>
  
  <p>When no remote is specified, by default the origin remote will be
  used, unless thereâ€™s an upstream branch configured for the current
  branch.</p>
  
  <p>The names of refs that are fetched, together with the object names
  they point at, are written to .git/FETCH_HEAD. This information may be
  used by scripts or other git commands, such as git-pull.</p>

<h2>git pull</h2>

<p>It will apply the changes from <strong>remote</strong> to the <strong>current branch</strong> in local...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch.
  In its default mode, git pull is shorthand for git fetch followed by
  git merge FETCH_HEAD.</p>
  
  <p>More precisely, git pull runs git fetch with the given parameters and
  calls git merge to merge the retrieved branch heads into the current
  branch. With --rebase, it runs git rebase instead of git merge.</p>
  
  <p> should be the name of a remote repository as passed to
  git-fetch<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nWYnQ.png" rel="noreferrer">1</a>.  can name an arbitrary remote ref (for example,
  the name of a tag) or even a collection of refs with corresponding
  remote-tracking branches (e.g., refs/heads/<em>:refs/remotes/origin/</em>),
  but usually it is the name of a branch in the remote repository.</p>
  
  <p>Default values for  and  are read from the
  "remote" and "merge" configuration for the current branch as set by
  git-branch --track.</p>

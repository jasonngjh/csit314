<h1>ECMAScript 6 + jQuery, 85 bytes</h1>

<pre><code>$({jQueryCode:(url)=&gt;location.replace(url)}).attr("jQueryCode")("http://example.com")
</code></pre>

<p>Please don't kill me, this is a joke. It's a joke. <em>This is a joke.</em></p>

<p>This did "provide an answer to the question", in the sense that it asked for a solution "using jQuery" which in this case entails forcing it into the equation somehow.</p>

<p>Ferrybig apparently needs the joke explained (still joking, I'm sure there are limited options on the review form), so without further ado:</p>

<p>Other answers are using jQuery's <code>attr()</code> on the <code>location</code> or <code>window</code> objects unnecessarily.</p>

<p>This answer also abuses it, but in a more ridiculous way. Instead of using it to set the location, this uses <code>attr()</code> to retrieve a function that sets the location.</p>

<p>The function is named <code>jQueryCode</code> even though there's nothing jQuery about it, and calling a function <code>somethingCode</code> is just horrible, especially when the something is not even a language.</p>

<p>The "85 bytes" is a reference to Code Golf. Golfing is obviously not something you should do outside of code golf, and furthermore this answer is clearly not actually golfed.</p>

<p>Basically, cringe.</p>

<p>No, json cannot have comments directly. However, as suggested by <a href="https://gist.github.com/MoOx/5271067#gistcomment-2786317" rel="noreferrer">this</a>, you can achieve a similar effect by doing something like</p>

<pre><code>{
    "//name": "Name comment here",
    "name": "Jack",

    "//age": "Age comment here",
    "age": "25"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Most json parsers will ignore properties that are not mapped.</p>

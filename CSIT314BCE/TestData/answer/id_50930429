<p>JSON doesn't allow comments, per se. The reasoning is utterly foolish, because you can use JSON <em>itself</em> to create comments, which obviates the reasoning entirely, <em>and</em> loads the parser data space for no good reason at all for <em>exactly</em> the same result and potential issues, such as they are: a JSON file with comments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If you try to put comments in (using <code>//</code> or <code>/* */</code> or <code>#</code> for instance), then some parsers will fail because this is strictly not
  within the JSON specification. So you should <em>never</em> do that.</strong></p>

<p>Here's a for instance, where my <a href="http://fyngyrz.com/?p=3389" rel="noreferrer">image manipulation system</a> has saved image notations and some basic formatted (comment) information relating to them (at the bottom):</p>

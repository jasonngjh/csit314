<p><strong>"use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in
   "strict mode".</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5.</li>
<li>It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier
versions of JavaScript.</li>
<li>The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be
executed in "strict mode".</li>
<li>With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>All modern browsers support "use strict" except <em>Internet Explorer 9 and lower</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantage</strong></p>

<p>If a developer used a library that was in strict mode, but the developer was used to working in normal mode, they might call some actions on the library that wouldn’t work as expected.</p>

<p>Worse, since the developer is in normal mode, they don’t have the advantages of extra errors being thrown, so the error might fail silently.</p>

<p>Also, as listed above, strict mode stops you from doing certain things.</p>

<p>People generally think that you shouldn’t use those things in the first place, but some developers don’t like the constraint and want to use all the features of the language.</p>

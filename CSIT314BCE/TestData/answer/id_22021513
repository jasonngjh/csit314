<p>It seems like most answers here are focused on the <code>master</code> branch; however, there are times when I'm working on the same feature branch in two different places and I want a rebase in one to be reflected in the other without a lot of jumping through hoops.</p>

<p>Based on a combination of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8888015/1103543">RNA's answer</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/19961461/1103543">torek's answer to a similar question</a>, I've come up with this which works splendidly:</p>

<pre><code>git fetch
git reset --hard @{u}
</code></pre>

<p>Run this from a branch and it'll only reset your local branch to the upstream version.</p>

<p>This can be nicely put into a git alias (<code>git forcepull</code>) as well:</p>

<p><code>git config alias.forcepull "!git fetch ; git reset --hard @{u}"</code></p>

<p>Or, in your <code>.gitconfig</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
  forcepull = "!git fetch ; git reset --hard @{u}"
</code></pre>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>If you just want to delete the files listed as untracked by 'git status'</p>

<pre><code>git stash save -u
git stash drop "stash@{0}"
</code></pre>

<p>I prefer this to 'git clean' because 'git clean' will delete files
ignored by git, so your next build will have to rebuild everything
and you may lose your IDE settings too.</p>

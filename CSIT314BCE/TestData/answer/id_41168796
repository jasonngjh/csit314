<p>I have found <a href="http://ohshitgit.com/" rel="noreferrer">this</a> site which describes how to undo things that you have committed into the repository.</p>

<p>Some commands:</p>

<pre><code>git commit --amend        # Change last commit
git reset HEAD~1 --soft   # Undo last commit
</code></pre>

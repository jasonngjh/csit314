<p>FOREWORD: this answer was written when the question was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like the old Albert said : "If you can't explain it to a six-year old, you really don't understand it yourself.‚Äù. Well I tried to explain JS closures to a 27 years old friend and completely failed.</p>
  
  <p>Can anybody consider that I am 6 and strangely interested in that subject ?</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I was one of the only people that attempted to take the initial question literally. Since then, the question has mutated several times, so my answer may now seem incredibly silly &amp; out of place. Hopefully the general idea of the story remains fun for some.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm a big fan of analogy and metaphor when explaining difficult concepts, so let me try my hand with a story.</p>

<p><strong>Once upon a time:</strong></p>

<p>There was a princess...</p>

<pre><code>function princess() {
</code></pre>

<p>She lived in a wonderful world full of adventures. She met her Prince Charming, rode around her world on a unicorn, battled dragons, encountered talking animals, and many other fantastical things.</p>

<pre><code>    var adventures = [];

    function princeCharming() { /* ... */ }

    var unicorn = { /* ... */ },
        dragons = [ /* ... */ ],
        squirrel = "Hello!";

    /* ... */
</code></pre>

<p>But she would always have to return back to her dull world of chores and grown-ups.</p>

<pre><code>    return {
</code></pre>

<p>And she would often tell them of her latest amazing adventure as a princess.</p>

<pre><code>        story: function() {
            return adventures[adventures.length - 1];
        }
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>But all they would see is a little girl...</p>

<pre><code>var littleGirl = princess();
</code></pre>

<p>...telling stories about magic and fantasy.</p>

<pre><code>littleGirl.story();
</code></pre>

<p>And even though the grown-ups knew of real princesses, they would never believe in the unicorns or dragons because they could never see them. The grown-ups said that they only existed inside the little girl's imagination.</p>

<p>But we know the real truth; that the little girl with the princess inside...</p>

<p>...is really a princess with a little girl inside.</p>

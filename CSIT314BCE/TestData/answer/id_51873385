  <p>I haved failed using most popular answers here - git doesn't delete
  untracked files from the repository anyway. No idea why. This is my
  super simplified answer without SPECIAL GIT COMMANDS!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mission: delete untracked files from git repository:</p>

<ol>
<li>Move files and folders elsewhere from your local project folder for a while</li>
<li>Delete all lines in .gitignore about these files and folders for the commit</li>
<li>Git add . </li>
<li>Git commit -m “Cleaning repository from untracked files”</li>
<li>Git push</li>
</ol>

<p>All files and folders has been deleted from the repository. </p>

<p>Lets restore them on localhost if you need them:</p>

<ol>
<li>Move back all files and folders you have moved temporary to the local project folder again</li>
<li>Move back all lines about these files and folders to .gitignore</li>
<li>Git add .</li>
<li>Git commit -m “Checking or files not appearing again in git repository”</li>
<li>Git push</li>
</ol>

<p>You are done!</p>

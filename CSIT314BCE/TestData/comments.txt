But it&#39;s not accurate to say the <i>range of int in C/C++ is ...</i> without any qualifiers.  C implementations for microcontrollers and DSPs with 16-bit <code>int</code> still widespread, and C only requires that the range be <i>at least</i> <code>-32767 .. 32767</code>, and that it&#39;s 2&#39;s complement, 1&#39;s complement, or sign/magnitude.  <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types</a>><Abhra
61652133><2020-05-07 23:35:44><Hmm, I wonder, since the signed overflow is undefined, could the compiler decide to treat the result as a <code>long</code> instead? Or maybe that&#39;s what you meant with inferring the type from the values, but did mention &quot;following ISO C rules that say the expression has type int&quot;, so I&#39;m exactly sure if that would be allowed.><T.J.Crowder
61652133><2020-05-07 23:53:59><@ilkkachu: My answer does kind of contradict itself &gt;.&lt;.  The source contains UB so the ISO C standard has literally nothing to say about what should happen along that entire path of execution before and after the UB is encountered.  Yes, it would be fine for <code>2147483647 + 1</code> to evaluate to an int64_t as far as ISO C is concerned.  But what compilers actually do is apply the ISO C type rules and then wrap the integer value during compile-time evaluation.  ISO C doesn&#39;t require that (or anything else) in the overflow case.  Phrasing suggestions or edits welcome.><polm23
61652133><2020-05-08 00:08:36><@ilkkachu: Updated with better phrasing.  Saying &quot;ISO C <i>requires</i> it to be UB&quot; implied all kinds of wrong ideas about what UB is.  e.g. that it&#39;s required to crash or required to warn, or whatever.  In fact it just means that you&#39;re in uncharted territory where the ISO C standard has nothing to say about the program.  Anything you choose to do is either just happens-to-work or implementation-defined behaviour.  (Implementations are 100% allowed to define any behaviour they want in cases where the standard doesn&#39;t define behaviour, e.g. like <code>gcc -fwrapv</code> or <code>-fno-strict-aliasing</code>.)><Bellan

I don&#39;t think you can run the resulting binaries under GNU/Linux, even if you had libraries.  <code>gcc -m64</code> and <code>gcc -m32</code> also have identical sizes for <code>int</code> and <code>long long</code>, only disagreeing about the width of <code>long</code>.

61644993><2020-05-08 03:50:47><@NassimAssaf: A typical CPU will have instructions to read or write 8/16/32/64 bits from/to a specified address.  Hardware will often be wired up so that some addresses are connected to &quot;ordinary&quot; memory, so a read will yield whatever value was last written, with no other side effects, but accesses to some other addresses will trigger specialized actions.  Some CPUs have &quot;IN&quot; and &quot;OUT&quot; instructions which output a &quot;this is an in or out instruction&quot; signal along with an address, but the main point is that hardware outside the CPU controls the effects of hitting addresses.  The CPU doesn&#39;t care.><Joshua

61602280><2020-05-06 14:08:22><IMO a correct answer. I&#39;d probably stress out more that in <code>const char *s=&quot;foo&quot;;</code> the <code>const</code> is telling something only about the pointer (cannot be used for writing), but tells nothing about the pointed-to object. Unfortunately a lot of C++ programmers (and even the standard library) confuses the two especially with references (i.e. in <code>const X&amp; x</code> the keyword <code>const</code> is relative to the <b>reference</b> only and tells nothing about the referenced object; passing a <code>const&amp;</code> is <b>not</b> a smart way to pass by value as you can run into lifetime or aliasing problems).><lewkka
61602280><2020-05-06 18:58:46><@6502: <code>const char *str</code> means that the pointed-to object is <code>const</code>, not the pointer.  We can write a new value to <code>str</code> (point it to a different object), but not to <code>*str</code> or <code>str[i]</code>.  <code>char * const str</code> means that the pointer itself is <code>const</code> and cannot be written to, but the thing it points to can be.><DavidSK
61602280><2020-05-06 20:56:15><No. The declaration <code>const char *str;</code> is a declaration of a &quot;read only pointer&quot; , i.e. a pointer that can be used for reading only... but that is a property of the pointer, it tells nothing about const-ness of pointed object. The pointed object can change, simply it cannot be changed <b>using that pointer</b> (but there can be for example other read/write pointers to the same object). A <code>const char *</code> is not a pointer to char that is const, it&#39;s a pointer to a char that cannot be used for writing.><Nathaniel

You can definitely use certain tricks to identify the presence of <code>undefined</code>, but at that point you&#39;re getting quite far into metaprogramming.

If you <i>know</i> they map to nothing, you assign them <code>null</code>, say, but when you don&#39;t know yet whether they&#39;ll map to something or not, you put them in the object but keep the value they&#39;re mapped to as <code>undefined</code> - i.e. the absence of a value><Xorlev

An observation: when doing your tests, you switched all the type signatures to be polymorphic instead of concrete. If you had started with the concrete type <code>level1 :: Int -&gt; Double</code> it would have stopped you in your tracks right there (or, if you had started with the concrete type <code>level1 :: Double -&gt; Double</code> then you would have soon discovered that your <code>level5</code> had no <code>Int</code> anywhere in its type signature).><rsan
61776855><2020-05-14 00:37:22><Numerical constants such as 1, 2, 6, may have any numeric type. You can check this in the_ghci_ interpreter, entering “:type 6”. So you only need the <code>(fromIntegral y)</code> converter. The <code>Int</code> type constraint on the argument x propagates unmitigated to y. Hence the type conflict in your initial code at the level of the “/” operator. Unlike in C C++ Fortran, there is no automatic numeric type promotion. You have to allow it explicitely for it to happen.><PremChand

I was confused by this as well. <code>constexpr</code> does imply <code>const</code> and will change the type, but it confusingly applies to the pointer s and not to the characters it points to, even if placed after <code>char</code>. Thus <code>constexpr char const * s = &quot;hello&quot;;</code> changes the type of s from a modifiable pointer to a const pointer. That is, it implies <code>const</code> after the pointer. Further, it is equivalent to <code>char const constexpr * s = &quot;hello&quot;;</code> : even though applied after <code>char</code>, it applies to the pointer.><Brettins

But anyway, the register modifier causes the generated assembly to refer to <code>%ah</code>, but the compiler still doesn&#39;t know that, and will try to load the input value into <code>%al</code> instead.  You can&#39;t see that in your example because you didn&#39;t initialize <code>a</code>.  But if you do initialize it, as in <a href="https://godbolt.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this example on godbolt</a>, you see that the resulting code is not what you want.><WaiHaLee
61722182><2020-05-11 12:58:33><In other words, I think <code>%h1</code> is completely opaque to the code generator.

So this really doesn&#39;t solve the problem.><OllieStrevel
61722182><2020-05-11 13:12:56><I think the register modifier feature is meant for a situation when you have a value loaded into a 32-bit register but your assembly only wants to operate on part of it.

Without that, the compiler may decide that the code doesn&#39;t have any observable results, and delete the entire body of the function. For code like this, part of the release procedure should be to check the assembly code of this function to make sure it was implemented correctly. And you need to check every call site in the assembly to make sure that the function is actually called, not inlined and optimized out. The optimizer is your adversary, watch it closely.><J&#246;rgWMittag

From the article you linked, your goal is: <i>&quot;an implementation in which every call to a subroutine always returns in exactly x seconds, where x is the maximum time it ever takes to execute that routine on every possible authorized input.&quot;</i> One way to achieve that is to take a high-precision time stamp at the beginning of the function, and then sit in a loop at the end of the function (doing meaningless computations similar to the actual algorithm) until <code>x</code> amount of has passed.><AndersKaseorg

So, by using the same <code>prefetch256()</code> function as done by OpenSSL&#39;s authors, how much confidence can I gain, that the probability of a cache timing attack on my implementation will be negligible ? The S-box table is used by the AES <code>SubBytes()</code> function. Should I call  prefetch256(sbox) on <i>every</i> round before <code>SubBytes()</code> is called ?><Brettins

61701596><2020-05-10 23:45:41><Thankyou for your explanation, but this new method drastically affects my performance, I tried to use uint32_t * for accessing my 256 byte s-box, to make <code>fetch_byte_from_table()</code> faster (and then extract the byte), but that will cause endianness issues on different platforms. Does replacing my 256 byte table with a two dimensional <code>unsigned char sbox[16][16]</code> array help against a cache timing  attack (again performance is compromised)?

61701596><2020-05-11 06:25:33><@VivekanandV: If you replace the table with an <code>unsigned char sbox[16][16]</code> you could reduce the number of dummy reads by a factor of 16 (e.g. <code>dummy ^= table[i][0];</code>); which would work if and only if cache line size is &gt;= 16 bytes. For most CPUs people still care about the cache line size is 64 bytes, so touching every 16th byte would be fine (and touching every 64th byte would be faster). However; this will increase complexity and reduce portability; and you&#39;d need to ensure the table is aligned on the chosen boundary (so there&#39;s no &quot;half a cache line&quot; that wasn&#39;t touched).><EricDuminil

61701596><2020-05-11 20:40:38><@VivekanandV: On a system with a single CPU, a &quot;fetcher thread&quot; wouldn&#39;t help. On a system with many CPUs normally there&#39;s no guarantee that your threads will be running at the same time (especially if attacker starts many threads to take CPUs away from your threads) so it won&#39;t help much in that case either. For some operating systems, there might be something intended for &quot;real-time scheduling guarantees&quot; that might be useful, but it&#39;d be incredibly difficult for an OS to provide that without allowing &quot;denial of service/CPU&quot; attacks.

For one example, for some CPUs (e.g. 64-bit 80x86 with AVX) you could load the whole table into registers once then use the registers for everything with no security risk (because you&#39;re not using memory/cache); but you&#39;d need to sacrifice portability. For another example, you could maybe interleave the S-box with the state array and do the substitutions in random order, so attacker can&#39;t guess why a cache line was used (sacrificing simplicity).><EricDuminil

Then move the file into the folder. That should be the procedure. Each of those small steps is fairly easy to research online. Try it out - that&#39;s the best way to learn, anyway. If you get stuck on a specific part, ask us about that exact problem.><Bellan
61792230><2020-05-14 16:42:10><You can simplify your file query, use <code>filenames = Directory.GetFiles(path, &quot;*.pdf&quot;, ....</code> and skip the Where()-part. To loop through your list, you can use a <code>foreach (file in filenames)</code>. As mentioned you can get the new filename with <code>file.Split(&quot;-&quot;)[0]</code> or with a regular expression. Then create a directory with <code>Directory.CreateDirectory</code> and move the file in with <code>System.IO.File.Move(&quot;oldfilename&quot;, &quot;newfilename&quot;);</code>. Now you have all the bricks and you only need to glue them together.><Narro

61793183><2020-05-14 17:34:31><I was afraid something like this was the only way. The current way I solve it is having the <code>MyService</code> have a kind of <code>getActualService&lt;T&gt;(): T</code> method which I call on the constructor (and acts as my factory), without defining a specific provider. This is what I wanted to avoid through DI (avoid having to do extra steps on the constructor of the type using the service, I mean), but yes, doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s possible :-/  I&#39;ll +1 your answer for now and wait to see if other answers come in. Thanks!><hobbs
61793183><2020-05-14 17:40:23><Thanks! I&#39;ve added one more example how to keep code cleaner in the class by moving things to providers, but anyway it requires usage factory for every type.><sideshowbarker
61793183><2020-05-14 17:42:53><Thanks for the edit: yes, what I meant was &quot;avoiding to have extra usage on the component using the service&quot; (not just the constructor, but all of it), while also not having to declare the provider for each of the possible &quot;workerServices&quot; (there will be a lot of those in real usage).  If I have to do that, the <code>getService&lt;T&gt;()</code> method on <code>MyService</code> looks as the &quot;cleanest&quot; possible way, and I do the &quot;hacky stuff&quot; (just use the injector in that method to dynamically get the instance) on <code>MyService</code> (which is already a &quot;hacky&quot; service involving <code>Proxy</code> objects and stuff)><sideshowbarker
